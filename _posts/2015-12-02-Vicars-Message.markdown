* THe word became flesh and dwelt among us* (John 1:14)

Dear Believers in Christ,

Whenever we feel rejected by the world, family or feel lonely turn to the Babe of Bethlehem, Who is Immanuel.  He is better than your closest friend or relative. Christmas is story of God.  God was transcendental being but through Christmas event God is with us, Immanuel.  Christmas story is not what we think of God but what God think of us, what God did for our salvation? This is God's story, this is gospel and great joy for whole world.  How much God loved world so He gave His only Son for the redemption of world. 

What is our response in Christmas season?  How much do we love our God through our Christmas activities.  Christmas is not celebration of drink, be merry, and eat which is more than this. It is a celebration of love, Peace and Joy all the celebrations should lead to world of justice, equality, & peace.  The entrance to the Church of Naitivity (the birth place of Jesus) at Bethlehem is only 4 feet height. Those who wish to visit the manger, where Christ was born we have to humble ourselves and bent down to enter the small door of the Naitivity Church.  If we become more humble then we can more experience the presence of Holy God. 

Christmas is supreme revelation of God.  Immanuel is a mysterious and precious name for us.  In past days god revealed in various ways but in Christmas world saw the glory of His only son. God is with us for what purpose?  God is with us to empower in our struggles, to be done perfect witness in earthly living.  God is with us to overcome all evils.  God is with us but are we really with Him?  Let Almighty God help us to receive his manifold blessing and mercy in this Christmas season too and be a fruitful witness of Christ where ever we are.  Let the Glory of God be with you all.

In Christ's ministry,
