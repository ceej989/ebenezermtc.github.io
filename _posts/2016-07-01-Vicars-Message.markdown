*Three times I pleaded with The Lord to take it away from me, but he said to me, My Grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weakness, so that Christ's power may rest on me (1 Corinthians 12:8-9)*

Dear believers in Christ, 

The uniqueness of Christianity is the Grace of God. It is Grace below us, above us, before us, behind us and beside us. It is a Grace in which we stand. Grace refers to that which God has given to us in Christ- not because we earned it or deserved it but because He willed to give it. Here Paul experienced a thorn in his flesh, but he overcame this by the Grace of God.

One day a little girl placed a cocoon that she found in a jar expecting to see butterfly emerge. One day she saw the butterfly within the cocoon trying to get out. It was struggling and trying to push its way out of the tight opening. In an effort to help the poor insect, she very carefully slit open the cocoon. After that, the butterfly was able to easily exit the cocoon. However, a strange thing happened. Instead of spreading two beautiful wings the butterfly had two useless ugly wings hanging by its side. Why did this happen? God designed the butterfly and its cocoon so that the tight opening would straighten and strengthen its wings. God has a purpose even in our weaknesses. 

**THE WEAKNESS OF LIFE KEEP US HUMBLE**

Because of all the blessings Paul had been given and because of all the mighty ways God had used him, there was a danger that Paul may try to take all of the Glory for himself. Therefore, God gave Paul this thorn to remind Paul that this was about God and not about Paul. In other words, it was sent to keep Paul humble.

**THE WEAKNESS OF LIFE HELP US TO DEEPEN OUR FAITH**

Notice that Paul's trials draw him to his knees. Often when the path of life is easy, we forget how much we need the Lord. We slack in our devotional lives and we tend to become a little too self-sufficient. But when trouble comes knocking, when we are pierced by one of the thorns of life, we are shocked back to reality once again. It is true that difficulty will drive us to our knees. 

This month we are celebrating independence day of United States of America. Let us celebrate this freedom with responsibility. Summer is the time of outdoor activities. Let all our summer get-togethers create great joy and fellowship in our lives. Be a true and faithful Christian disciple in all our living situations. May Almighty God bless each one of us with abundant blessings.

With love and prayers,
