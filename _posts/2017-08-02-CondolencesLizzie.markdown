Dear Members and friends of Ebenezer Mar Thoma Church, Portchester, 

With great sadness I announce that Mrs. Lizziamma Kuruvilla , sister of Koshykunju Ninan , enters in to eternity this morning. She and her family was a great friend of our church.
Please remember the bereaved family in your prayers. May God comfort them in His heavenly Peace.  With Regret. C. S. Chacko
