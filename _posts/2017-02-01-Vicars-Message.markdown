Many Americans are going away from its roots. Bible centered spiritual roots of our nation are neglected by secularization . In the early stage do you know what Americans had done ? The first public building they erected was a Church building. The first public exercise was the worship of Almighty God. When sorrow comes they gathered at the Church to appeal to God for help. When the bountiful harvest fill their barns they gathered at the Church for thanksgiving to God.


Our Fathers had a strong desires to please God and do His will. `Around 150 years passed by from the time of the early settlers , we are not very proud of some of the things that happened during these years. The spiritual atmosphere are different, youths are going away from Church, some Churches are in a dying stage. In World lot of people have dream and temptation to enjoy American life ie; to enjoy the fruits of citizenship of America without any sacrifice to this nation. 
As poet says 
					> "We  eat  from  orchards
         			> we didn't plant.
         			> We  drink  from  the  wells
         			> we didn't  dig
         			> We  reap  from  the  field
         			> we didn't  sow"
	      
When we experience more facilities of this nation we should have more commitment and sacrifice for good tradition of America.
                        
PARADOX OF OUR TIME
                 > " We have taller buildings but shorter tempers wider freeways but narrow viewpoints . We spent more but we have less. We buy more  but we enjoy  less. We have bigger houses and smaller families . We have more convenience but less time. We have more degrees but less sense. We have more medicine but less wellness. We have multiplied our possessions but reduced our values . We talk too much do little. We have learned how to make a living not a life.  We have been all the way to the moon  and  back but the trouble in crossing the street to meet the neighbor."  

For the blessing of America we must pray unceasingly for  America . We must  live righteously , we must be the Gospel to evangelize this country. It is our privilege to be here in this nation, and to use its facilities as stewards of God . May God Almighty bless all of us to be faithful witness in America.
