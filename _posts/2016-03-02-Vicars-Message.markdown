Dear Believers in Christ,

Why do we have to rejoice in Christ Almighty?

1. He is the eternal God who is the root and cause of joy-nothing can steal that joy.  The prophet Habakkuk teaches us to trust God  in any circumstances. "Though the fig tree may not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines, though the labor of the olive may fail, and the fields yield no fruit, though the flock may be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stall  yet I will rejoice in the Lord" (Hab 3:17- 18). Nothing will steal your joy if it is rooted in God Almighty because He is the God of joy and salvation.

2. Rejoice because your name is written in Heaven and the book of life.
         ** "Rejoice because your name is written in Heaven"( Luke 10:20). **
We are Christian so we have lot of things to rejoice about when we reflect on what God Almighty has done for us. When we analyze our life we genuinely we have lot of things to praise God for. What is the destiny of our life? We should have a meaningful existence in our worldly and Heavenly life with God.

3. Rejoice because God is a provider of your daily life.  When we take a breath, you have a reason to praise God. For a small piece of fish on your table you should be thankful to lot of people. A series of miracles occur frequently in our lives, so let us create a culture of gratitude for what God has provided for us and avoid culture of complaining . He cares for the birds of air and lilies of the field and He will definitely take care of us because we are created in the likeness and image of God.

4. Rejoice because Jesus Christ will come back.  All of the chaotic situations we face will be changed into Godly  order. God will rule all the cosmos with mighty power. He will judge all of the unrighteous. He is the alpha and the omega. He only knows the beginning and end of the existing world. It is the hope and possibility of Christianity in the midst of suffering and tribulations, that Jesus Christ will come and restore all relationships for perfect joy.   
                                
                          "Watch your thoughts for they become words
                           Watch your words for they become actions
                           Watch your actions for they become habits
                           Watch your habits for they become character
                           Watch you character for they become destiny"
                      
At the end of this month we are going to celebrate  Easter because He is a God of life. Let us renew our commitments in Christ and meaningful observances of the Lent season. Let us strive for a meaningful mission for Jesus Christ of perfect  Christian witness. May God Almighty bless you all with perfect happiness and joy.


In Christ's ministry,
