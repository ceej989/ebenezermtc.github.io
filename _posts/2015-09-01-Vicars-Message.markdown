Dear Believers in Christ,

Early Church is true sign of communion, community, & communism. The Greek word *Koinonia* means genuine fellowship.

1 Communion- Communion with God. Early Church had  deep rooted fellowship with God. Everyday they gathered together and worship God with sincere heart .

2  Community- Early Church had strong Community feeling . They stood before God as community . They firmly affirm oneness in Christ and togetherness in brotherhood.

3 Communism-Literally means sharing of material things. They shared everything they have. Their faith was costly faith . They were ready to share everything not only their material things but their life too. This was the life style of early church.

Jesus Christ stood for real Koinonia. Our task is to establish real Christian fellowship in our home, neighborhood, Church and whole world. We need genuine fellowship with God and sense of community conscious also stewardship in material possessions. We need costly faith to create Kingdom of God with equality & justice. Let us move from comfort Zone to risky Zone to fulfill God's mission that needs costly faith. Lord create in us a new heart  and fill your spirit in us, so that we can present our bodies as a living sacrifice acceptable to you. May God bless us in coming days.


May Almighty God empower us now and forever.

In Christ's ministry,
