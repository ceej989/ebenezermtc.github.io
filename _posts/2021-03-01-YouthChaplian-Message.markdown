Dearly Beloved in Christ,

As we are on our observing these days as lent, let us continue to look within ourselves and analyze our lives on where we depend on our self-worth. This Lenten period should remind us that it is not about what the world or the people in this world that brings us the sense of worth, but what God sees us as precious. It is because we are seen unconditionally as precious to God that He in Christ moved forward in the journey to the cross. St. John 5:1-9 speaks of the healing of the lame man by a pool. In this, Jesus asked him a question: “do you want to get well?” (v.6). This is the question we should ask ourselves. Our worth in the eyes of the world should not hinder us from wanting to be made well. We should not focus on this world but keep our eyes on God. With that focus, we should want to be made well. Not just for our physical struggles, but also to be made well in the sight of the Lord. Only if we really want to change ourselves and our situation, it is a start to a journey of sanctification and healing. The challenges of this world can be focused too much to a point that it seems hopeless, and we must remind ourselves that only God can guide us to overcome any obstacle in this world. Especially if it is the obstacle of sin. Our desire for God over the world’s desires guides us towards the process of healing. Lent should be a vessel that helps us sharpen ourselves for the same.

We are in the third month of the year. As we can remember, March marks one year for the lockdown. Let us continue to pray for the world and holistic healing. In our uncomfortable circumstances, let us continue to trust God. We are not made to be comfortable in this world, we should be thankful for even the uncomfortable situations in our lives.

Our College Ministry Bible Study is on every Tuesday evening on the ZOOM platform. Please do ask your parish youth fellowship secretaries for the information and have our young ones join.

Let us pray for this month to be a blessing to all of us so that we can be a blessing to the people we encounter every day in our lives.




Much Love,

Jess M George Achen
