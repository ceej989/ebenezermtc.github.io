Dear believers in Christ, 

The Church is the body of Christ. The Church is facing lot of burning issues  ie; traditional, theological, doctrinal, cultural, gender, liturgical, etc. As a body of
Christ we have to discern will of Jesus Christ in the crisis situation of the Churches. Let us analyze some burning issues that attacks the fabric of Church foundation.

1. The crisis of unattended Church

We need to attend the Church. We need to defend the Church and recommend the Church. Christianity without worship is lifeless and powerless.

2. The crisis of unbent knees before God or prayer experience

We have to experience how is the problem before the prayer and after the prayer ? Please pray for our companion , children , Church , country etc. Prayer is the responsibility before God and fellow beings . 

3. The crisis of untrained children

Children are gift of God. How is our generation growing in today's context ? In home we have switch or regulator for everything except children. Train children to have respect for elders , responsibility for action and need to be taught them discipline. 

4. The crisis of unreading habit of The Bible or Bible centered life

We need to love the Holy Bible ,and learn from the Bible. We have to lead a Christian life on the foundation of Bible teachings. Bible needs tobe in our head, heart, hand and in our home.

5. The crisis of unconfessed sin

Unconfessed sin blocks channels of blessing. People are doing private sins and public sins, but almighty God knows very well every situations of human life. What is sin? Doing, he knows what is wrong and doing not, what is right. Due to unconfessed lifestyle we see crisis of unfaithful living and unconcerned witness.

6. We are being attacked not from outside but from the inside

Many time our lifestyle is contradicting to Jesus teaching because we are leading world centered lifestyle that is against Kingdom values. So often our lifestyle is entirely different from Christ's teaching, praxis and life. So Church is facing her big enemies from inside, not from outside of the Church. 
Don't teach lukewarm Gospel which do not have power to save, convert and transform the people. When we deliver cheap standard and weak messages we cannot gain lost and sinners for Jesus. We must  remember we are not closed Church it is open now and forever. The world has more influence in our Church life so we have to fight against it with spiritual weapons that is Bible, worship, prayer. fasting and fellowship. May The Holy Spirit empower us to lead a meaningful worship in the midst of different crisis and tribulations.



With love and prayers,
