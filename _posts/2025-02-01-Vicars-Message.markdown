Dearly Beloved in Christ, 

Greetings to you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. By the Grace of God, we are in the second month of this New Year. Let us thank God for all His blessings but remember that our blessings are given with the hope that we will always repent and turn to our Triune God, not when it is “convenient.” God is greater than
any challenges we are facing. God will carry us through it. Now it is time for us to rededicate ourselves wholeheartedly to putting on the love of Christ, regarding one another through the eyes of Jesus, and loving one another as he loves us. Because we are his Body, there can be no other way for us than this. May the love of the Father
sustain us; may the light of the Son enfold us; may the power of the Holy Spirit make us bold. 



The 130th session of the Maramon Convention will take place from February 09-16, 2025. Many people from around the world will be attending this year’s convention, which includes bible studies, intercessory prayers, devotions, and messages. Several from the USA are attending. I humbly request that you view the livestream and pray for God’s blessings upon the convention. Many of the messages are in English and translated to Malayalam. I encourage you to listen to some of the messages for spiritual fulfillment and renewal. Our Diocesan Sunday is scheduled for Sunday, March 02, 2025. As per the arrangements of the pulpit exchange, the Rev. Jobin John (Vicar, Bethany MTC, NY) will be visiting our parish during that weekend. Kindly uphold the mission and ministry of our Diocese in your prayers. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to office bearers, executive committee members and other spiritual organizations of 2024. The church family wanted to say a big thank you for your time and effort in helping in our Church ministering during the past years. I appreciate the care, time and energy you have given. You have definitely raised the level, and your guidance of the team has certainly been exemplary. I really appreciate and may the good Lord reward you abundantly and bless the work of your hands. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate new executive committee for the responsibility that the Lord has given you. May the love of God be upon you as you endeavor to serve in the new roles that the Lord has bestowed upon your shoulders.
May the grace, mercy, and blessings of our Triune God, be with you all. Remain steadfast, faithful, and hopeful! We are thankful to God for each one of you. Prayers for you All.

Yours in Christ’s ministry,

Rev. George Abraham

Vicar
