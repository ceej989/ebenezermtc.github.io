Lent Prayer scheduled for tomorrow March 18th at the residence of Jacob Abraham is canceled. We will have Lent Prayer at church on Thursday 19th March. 

*This change is due to the sad demise of St . Andrews' member Mr.A.V.Thomas who left for heavenly abode on Tuesday morning and a prayer meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at St . Andrews church.Please remember the bereaved family in your prayers. *
