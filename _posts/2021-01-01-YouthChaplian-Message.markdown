Dearly Beloved in Christ,

We have reached a new month and moreover a new year.  Usually, year after year we attempt to have new year’s resolutions.  I say we attempt because it is usually difficult to follow through on many of the goals we try accomplishing as well as to rethink our own lifestyle and seek change for the coming year.  We need to realize that failure is part of life, and as human beings, yes, we will fall.  But to get up and persevere faithfully is what matters.  God looks at how faithful we are.  Let us take a moment to retrospect and introspect our lives and see in what ways we need to sharpen ourselves for this new year.  Let us also help one another to be closer to God in this coming year.  Human beings are meant to journey with one another and to encourage each other.  Last year was tough for all of us, it is important to be available and to help.  If we all have a willing mind and heart, we can be agents of healing in this broken world.


According to the lectionary, this month on January 10th, we commemorate Temperance Day with the theme: Worthy Life.  This world is full of temptations and through that, the human body is prone to many different types of addictions.  Let us see our bodies as a sacred space.  Let us treat our bodies with respect and dignity.  Therefore, we need God’s help.  God should work through us.  Philippians 4:13 says that we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.  Christ can give us the strength to resist temptations and to overcome addictions.  Let us see what we are addicted to and discipline our lives away from those addictions and use more time for prayer.  By this, we can see that God can work through us.  God is worthy of all worship and honor and our lives should also be a worthy sacrifice to God in full submission to Him.


Wishing everyone NOT a prosperous, but a blessed new year so that we can be a blessing to others.



Much Love,

Jess M George Achen
