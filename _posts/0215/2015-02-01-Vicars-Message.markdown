Dearly Beloved In Christ,       
God's word is unpredictable in its power. The Gospel speaks of a seed which once sown grows by itself, even as the farmer sleeps. The church has to accept this unruly freedom of the word, which accomplishes what it wills in ways that surpass our calculations and ways of thinking. The joy of the gospel is for all the people; no one can be excluded.  That is what the angel proclaimed the good news to the shepherds. The Book Of Revelation speaks of an eternal Gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth to every nation and tongue and tribe and people (Rev:14:6).

The church is herself a missionary disciple, she needs to grow in her interpretation of the revealed word and in her understanding of truth. At the same time, today's vast and rapid cultural changes demand that we constantly seek ways of expressing unchanging truths in a language which brings out their abiding newness. The deposits of the faith is one thing - the way it is expressed is another. "Let us never forget that the expression of truth can take different forms". So try to understand the truth. A small step, in the midst of great human limitations. Can be more pleasing to God than a life which appears outwardly in order but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties.

The church is called to be the house of the Father, with doors always wide open. We are in an age of knowledge and information, which has led to new and often anonymous kinds of power. The joy of living frequently fades, lack of respect for others and violence are on the rise and inequality is increasingly evident. A number of diseases are spreading- The hearts of many people are gripped by fear and desperation, even in the So- called rich countries.

We need to distinguish clearly what might be a fruit of the kingdom from what runs counter to God's plan. This involves not only recognition and discerning spirits, but also and this is decisive- choosing - movements of the spirit of God and rejecting those of the spirit of evil.

MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL
