Dear Believers in Christ,

How will you observe lent this year?  You may say I will give up something for lent, I will no longer watch my favorite, I will not eat chocolate, I will not listen my favorite CD.  Lent is a time of self denial and it is a time to give up sinful activities to become new creation in Christ.  We are Christian on Sunday but unbeliever on other days, look at how religious we are?  Are we leading life of hypocrisy? Lent is a time to dismantle all type of hypocrisy.

What is Lent? We know the story of Pharisee and tax collector.  Lent is that; man who stood in the back of the temple and looked down at the ground and prayed to God "Lord have mercy on me, I am a sinner".  Lent is a time for to be like that to give up our sinful habits, sinful attitudes and ask God for our forgiveness.  Lent is an attitude, it is an attitude of honesty and humility, in coming days it is time for us to look deep into our heart and reflect on our life, how is our life?

What are you going to give up in this lentern season? We begin to walk to the road of cross which doesn't end at the tomb of Christ.  Our spiritual journey goes beyond that because He had risen from death to life.  Lent is a time of reflection and repentance.  Lent is a time of gratitude.  It is an occasion of apologies and atonements.  It is all about maturing in our faith and growing in our holiness.  Lent season is the time for preparation, diversion and separation to become perfect human being for the fulfillment of Kingdom of God. Lent is a time for discipline and self examination.  If we want to live with Holy God we need disciplined Christian life, that is the main vision of great lent.  During the lent season let us give more time for prayer and fasting.

In Christ's ministry,
