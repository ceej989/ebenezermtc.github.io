_"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."_ - 2 Timothy 2:15 (KJV)
 
The second Sunday of October has been set aside by our church as “The Day for People with Special Skills.”  This is a special day where we remember that people that are differently abled are also children of God and are to be accepted as equals.  
            
Leviticus 19:14 states:
_“You shall not revile the deaf or put a stumbling block before the blind; you shall fear your God:  I am the Lord.”_


Even though a deaf person cannot hear and a blind person cannot see, God can hear and see.  The Old Testament teaches us that all people are children of God and are loved by God.  Further in this same chapter we have that familiar command to _“love your neighbor as yourself"_ (Leviticus 19:18).  The justification for these commands is also given _“I am the Lord"_ (Leviticus 19:14 and 18).  


These commands are to be followed because they are given to us by God.  It is that simple.  Job when trying to show that he is a righteous person states _“I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame"_ (Job 29:15.)


In our community and in society there are people who are differently abled.  We not only need to uphold them in prayers, but we also need to love them and make them feel welcomed.  We need to make them feel like God’s children.
