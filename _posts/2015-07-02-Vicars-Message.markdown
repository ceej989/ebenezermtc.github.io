Greetings in the name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,

Cain murdered his own brother out of envy and hatred. Christians are called to minister all segments of society. What is our concern to socially marginalised people? Where is our brother and sister? In the recent earthquake that shook Nepal, thousands of our brothers and sisters lost their lives. Even though they are not practicing our faith, we have a responsibility to them. Recently in America also we saw arrogant nature of some people by killing innocent people.

Cain's arrogant response is a sinful thing. It is my responsibility to search where my brother or sister is. It is the command of Lord to love your neighbor. A morally sick society really needs Jesus's presence. So we have to wake up and take up mission of Lord for the salvation and healing of morally sick world.

This month we have major programs of our Diocese such as American family conference, Diocesan Clergy conference, Diocesan assembly, Senior Junior Camp, Region-Center Conferences, VBS, etc. Please pray for all the programs to conduct for the Glory of God. Let us pray and prepare for the up coming programs of our Parish for the extension of the Kingdom of God. May the Grace of our Lord be with us for now and forever.

In Christ's ministry,

Sony Achen
