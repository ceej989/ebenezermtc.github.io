_"Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live””_ (John 11:25)


The raising of the dead Lazarus to life is the last sign of the seven signs recorded in the John’s Gospel. The evangelist John has placed this sign in a context of Jesus getting ready to die on the cross. And this sign has gained special eminence because it focused on the restoration of life and also on the authority of Jesus over the life. Jesus though heard that Lazarus was ill, he did not immediately rush to Bethany which was just 3km away from where Jesus was, instead he waited for two days to visit Lazarus whom he loved. Jesus wanted to create an opportunity to bring out the message of resurrection and life which was made clear in the later dialogue with Martha. 
According to Genesis 15:6,” Abram believed the Lord; and the Lord reckoned it to him as righteousness.” 
One is to believe the Lord to be considered as righteous and now according to the disclosure of Jesus, the same belief leads to the resurrection. When a person believes in Jesus Christ the Lord, he/she gains a quality of life where death has no dominion over life rather becomes a process through which one enters into heavenly abode which is everlasting. Jesus Christ here in his self-revelation expounds that he himself is the resurrection and life. 
And he supplemented it by saying that “**those who believe in me, even though they die, will live**”. 

Jesus is expecting that _all who believes in him will act and will react like Him_. 

Believing in Jesus is _to accept and acclaim Jesus Christ as the incarnation of God and Savior of the World_. 

Believing in Jesus is _to be born in_ Christ. 

Believing in Jesus is _to be washed in_ Christ. 

Believing in Jesus is _to imitate_ Christ. 

Believing in Jesus is _to adopt_ Christ’s _liberative motifs and acts_.

Believing in Jesus is _to be fed in_ Christ. 

Believing in Jesus Christ is _to experience His sufferings_. 

Believing in Jesus is _to be raised with_ Jesus Christ. 

Believing in Jesus Christ is combating the evil forces in the world and responding to the situations where there is oppression and injustice. 

Therefore, believing in Jesus Christ is putting end to the dark forces and to discern new life to live in Jesus to lead life in its fullness now and even after death. 


May God Almighty will help us all, Amen.

May God Almighty will help us to lead a blessed life now and for evermore, Amen.
