DEARLY BELOVED IN CHRIST,   

As the vicar of this parish this is my last message through The News Letter.  I sincerely express our gratitude to all of you for your care, Prayer, advice, ideas, physical and mental support and also the gifts as you give us in the past days. This was my first outside Indian experience. I never expect to come over here, but this is God's purpose. I am unworthy in various ways, but God strengthened me all these days and also my ministry in the past. I thank the Almighty God for His manifold  blessings showered upon us. We express thanks to our beloved Theodosius Thirumeni for all his guidance and support , Diocesan secretaries , office bearers  and all the families who loved us and take care of us. Once again I whole heartedly express our love and gratitude which is not express only through words.

Relationships are fragile. Even positive relationships are easily subject to fracture. Handle them with care- Relationships are perishable, without steady and strong nourishment, they can wither and die. The relationship between you and your God is vulnerable too. Constant attention without distraction or obstruction is the natural requirement to sustain the life in love , under life's stress and new setbacks, the initial burst of pride can lose it luster. The booster forces that feed your dignity lose their energy too quickly. Your one essential relationship needs an unfailing power source to keep it pumping your self - esteem up through good and bad times.

Self - respect, positive self - regard, whole some self - esteem, healthy humble pride have short life -spans as did the manna from heaven that was given to the Israelites, on the move from Egypt to the promised land. It was sweet. It was nutritious , it was delicious. They couldn't get enough of it. So they tried to horde it, stash it away, and save it for a rainy day. But it soon spoiled.

RELAX - To quiet your mind and hear the inner voice.  
RETREAT - To get a fresh perspective , on your life with its problems and possibilities.

REGROUP - Your spiritual resources, marshall their potentially creative power and focus on your God - inspired dreams again. 

REGAIN - Your peace of mind. Let your spirit flow again in harmony with the eternal spirit. 

REJOICE - Rejoice in the lord always. The existing happiness is from God.

We request to all of you to remember us occasionally in your prayers, we will pray for you. As we move to another parish at Naranganam near Kozhencherry , we whole heartedly welcomes you any time you are in Kerala. WE are going back to Kerala with lot of good memories and experience gained from you. " You shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life , so that in the day of Christ I may proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. I am glad and rejoice with you all, Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice. The Grace of  the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all dearly beloved.  

JESUS CHRIST IS RISEN

MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL

Lovingly,
Sujan Achen
