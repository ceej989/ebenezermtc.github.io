Hi everyone,

We are going to have VBS on **Friday July 14th, Saturday July 15th, and conclude on Sunday July 16th**.  Our theme is going to be **Hero Central:  Discover Your Strength in God!**

**Hero Bible Verse:** Do good! Seek peace and go after it! (*Psalm 34:14b*)
First and foremost, we need everyone’s prayers and support to make it a success and meaningful for all that attend especially our children.  Without your prayers and support, none of it will be possible, so please continue that for those that attend and teach and volunteer for VBS.

Next, please see about inviting your families’ kids, cousins or friends’ kids to VBS so we have more participation.  I would like to not just have our children and youth participate but those in our extended community, so again please invite those who would want to attend and have fun and learn more about the word of God.

In order for some of our preparation which includes ordering VBS materials, we need to get an idea of how many of our own children and youth will be attending along with others we may be inviting.  If you could please reply back by end of this week, so I can get an idea it would be greatly appreciated.  I hope to hear from everyone sooner than later with the count of those attending.

I will also be looking for our Sunday School teachers and older youth and college students to help volunteer.  I will hunt you down, oops, just kidding!!  I mean ask you, so please come ask me to volunteer because help is always needed for VBS to be a success.  ☺

We are excited to have Biji Achen and family attend as well, and let’s make our VBS spiritually rewarding and fun for all especially our kids!!

Again thank you for everyone’s prayers and support.  Take care.

Ben Jacob
