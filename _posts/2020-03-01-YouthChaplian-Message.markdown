Dearly Beloved in Christ,

As we all come to the third month of the year, we are continuing our journey of the Great Lent for 31 of the total 50 days.  Most of our Lenten season is devoted in this month.  In our liturgical calendar, March guides us to understand the person of Jesus Christ and meditate deeply on who He is, especially in what we see in His earthly ministry.  Our lectionary is dedicated with rich Bible portions shared throughout the readings of each Sunday to have us understand Christ as ultimately, One who is full of love.  Each week we can study to understand Christ as One who cleanses, forgives, accepts, redeems, and restores.  Without a loving heart, it is impossible to abide in any of these things.  Christ loves all of us unconditionally, and by that unconditional love, it guides His ministry to love holistically.  It fulfills and completes.  This Lenten season, especially as we meditate on the person of Christ this month, it should guide us to also see if our lives in relation to Christ, if it is fulfilling His ministry in us to others or are we just getting by and minding our own business.  In order to love, we must be willing to get out of our way and be uncomfortable.  That is where healing happens.  Jesus puts first the least and the last and made many stops on His way to show that love.  We are all living in a fast-paced world where we find it difficult to stop along the way.  We usually look straight and forget those who are in need and cannot feel the love of God.  Godâ€™s love is too great that it should overflow our cup of life and fill others. 

This Lenten journey, our prayer shall be to sharpen ourselves and understand who Christ is as a person and devote our lives to mirror His love so that others can know who He is through us. 

Happy, and blessed March to everyone. 


Much Love,

Jess Achen
