Dearly beloved in Christ,

June is a month of school vacation and where we see sunshine and enjoy the warm weather outside.  Growing up, i remember taking my bicycle and riding around the neighborhood, playing with friends, as well as enjoy a game of basketball.  But now days, it is very difficult in the technocratic society to have the desire to go out.  We are more into the virtual world and stuck on the sofa.  Let us make it a point this summer to understand the weather around us is a blessing and we should make use of this blessing and enjoy the creation God made for us to enjoy and keep our body, mind and spirit healthy and active through personal relationships, activity and fresh air.  The three months given to us as a break is to divert our mind from the studies and focus on having fun and spending time with one another.  How are we going to use this vacation period?


The first Sunday is known as Student’s Day.  It is not just for young people, but for all of us.  Being a student is a lifelong identity that we have.  Let us pray for God’s wisdom and strength to attain godly wisdom so that we can not only be blessed but live as a blessing so that others can see Christ working always in our lives in love.


Happy June to all!  Enjoy your vacation!


Much Love,

Jess Achen
