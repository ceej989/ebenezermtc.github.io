_"The effect of righteousness will be peace and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust forever.”_ (Isaiah 32:17)

Isaiah 32:15-20 deals with the Age of the Spirit (until a spirit from on high is poured out on us, - v. 15), or to state it another way when the Spirit of God comes upon his children. This gift of the Spirit will result in drastic transformations and true happiness for all humanity. The wilderness will become like a fruitful field (v. 15), and the fruitful field is so dense that it becomes like a forest (v. 15). Justice and righteousness will extend to the wilderness and the fields (v. 16.) This is another way of saying that justice and righteousness will extend to all parts of the world. 


In the past when Israel faced threats and difficulties they turned to other nations and put their trust in alliances with these countries. This trust was misplaced and resulted in the destruction of Israel. However, the prophet sees a day when the God’s Spirit comes upon the people and they will be transformed into the people that God intended them to be. They will place their trust in God and by His Spirit, become righteous. Righteousness means having the right relationship with God and with others. 


In verse 17 we see that righteousness will result in peace, quietness, and trust. For a nation that was conquered by the Babylonians these were powerful words of encouragement. The righteous will have trust in God and in the plans of God. This trust will allow then to live in peace and quiet, despite what the circumstances of life are. 


The peace that God provides is the peace that the world needs. It is a peace that is internal (inside a person) and external (between people.) This peace can only be obtained by a righteous life. May God enable all of us to have such a righteous life - a life where we have the right relationship with God and with those around us.
