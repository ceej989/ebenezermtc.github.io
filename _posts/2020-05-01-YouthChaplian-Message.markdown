Dearly Beloved in Christ,

The last couple of months have been difficult for all of us. Many are now required to live uncomfortably and must take on much measures of safety. Many of our own have COVID-19 and sadly a few have passed away. Fear is now a factor that is there in people, and that fear is mostly caused by uncertainty. Through this difficult and confusing time, we are trying to always ask ourselves ‘how can we make sense of all this?’  The answer is three words and may seem hard to digest: “we alone cannot”. In that statement, we as God’s children should not see it as without hope. That statement has truth of all hope as we cannot deal with this by ourselves and are not required to do so also. It should remind us that we are not alone. God is the one who brings sense in our times of uncertainty by having us understand that He is in control and has plans for each one of us, even in our challenges and suffering. The famous verse we know says it clearly: Jeremiah 29:11- “For surely I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for your welfare and not for harm, to give you a future with hope.”  Yes, our future should be full of hope as we know our hope does not come from ourselves, but it comes from God alone. We should not be in control of the present-day situation, God is in control, leave it all to God and trust Him. Together we will overcome and come out strong as we are an army of God.


Although we are not meeting physically at the Church, we are spending more time with our family and giving much importance to family prayer, I advise all of our members to find it important to spend time in prayer with family as it brings us together, our churches are using the forum of social media to gather for cyber services, I encourage all to make it a point to connect every Sunday.  We as a regional youth fellowship have English divine service every Sunday evening at 5pm through zoom and as we all have morning worship, I encourage our youths to also come for evening worship with us, your youth secretary have the zoom link for the service.


Let us remember each one of us in prayers, especially those who are affected through COVID-19 as well as various other illnesses. Let us also pray for comfort for the bereaved family members. We will overcome, with God by our side, yes indeed we will overcome.


Much Love,

Jess Achen
