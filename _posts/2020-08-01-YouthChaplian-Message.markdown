Dearly Beloved in Christ,

As we embark a new month in August, it is a month in which the younger generation would have to wind up their vacation and return to the field of education. Let us pray for our children and the new chapter in their lives. Now many people are trying to figure out how to move forward with ways of life such as studies with options like live classes as well as virtual learning. Let us continue to pray for the present situation by trusting God. Life is full of challenges and uncomfortable situations; it comes to us to choose to not let the frustrations we face get the best of us. It is difficult to do so, but we need to see each situation as obstacles that we face to learn. We should also be willing to be uncomfortable in our full surrender to God. As a faith community, in God’s time, we will overcome.

Let us thank God for our motherland India as we celebrate Indian Independence Day on August 15th. Let us reflect in the last 73 years of God’s blessings. Let us thank God for the mode of peaceful demonstrations that ultimately empowered India to be free. Although through nonviolent demonstrations that brought India freedom, there is still hurt and pain going on in the present day and let us pray that the peace of God may come upon India, the United States and the whole world at large.

The current situations are not easy for any of us; God calls us to be there for one another. I encourage all of you to be empowered by the words of the Late Abraham Mar Thoma Metropolitan: “every marthomite is a missionary”. By this, be willing to be available and a listening ear to those going through emotional, physical, or spiritual challenges.

Wishing everyone a blessed August.


Much Love,

Jess Achen
