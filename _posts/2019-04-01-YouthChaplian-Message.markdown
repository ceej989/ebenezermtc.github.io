Acts 20:36-38 NRSV - When he had finished speaking, he knelt down with them all and prayed.  There was much weeping among them all; they embraced Paul and kissed him, grieving especially because of what he had said; that they would not see him again.  Then they brought him to the ship.  
      

Paul on his way to Rome was speaking to the elders of the church at Ephesus.  Paul reminded them of how he preached the gospel to them.  He also reminded them that they should keep watch over "the flock" especially the weak.  He commended them to God and to the message of his grace, "a message that is able to build you up and give you the inheritance among all who are sanctified (v. 32).
    

At the end of four years as the North East Regional Youth Chaplain, I hope and pray that like Paul, I was able to effectively communicate the gospel message to you.  Not only by word but like Paul, by action as well.  Also like the elders of the church at Ephesus, I hope and pray that all of you keep watch over the flock - the members of your family, your church, and you community.  Remember, those that truly accept the gospel message live a transformed life here on Earth and will received eternal life.
   

It will be a blessing to meet you again here on Earth.  But it would be a greater blessing to see you in heaven.
    

May God bless us all.  Thanks and prayers to all those who have helped, supported, and loved us these last four years. May all of you continue to grow in Christ under the blessed ministry of Rev. Jess and family.
