Dear Believers in Christ,

The transcendent God became immanent - Emmanuel  ie: God is with us.
Jesus  is the  pre-existent word.  Jesus is the constant word. Jesus  Christ was not an after  thought with God. Jesus was there when God moved to make us in  His image. Jesus is the communicative word  of Divinity. Jesus is the illuminating word. Jesus came to proclaim  light.  He came to world which  was in a spiritual darkness and opened the Grace of God to the people of darkness.  They will respond positively to the light of God will come to Jesus.  They will receive Him in their heart and will experience a new birth.  Jesus is the indwelling word the word became flesh and dwelled among  us. He lived among  us, worked among us, prayed among us, suffered among us, and died among us.  Jesus came as tangible proof of the existence of God and God's willingness to save human kind.  


This month we are observing mission Sunday, youth Sunday & family Sunday.  Our mission is intervention in the neighbourhood to do God's will, and help with the  mission activities of the church.  Youthhood is an important stage of life to glorify God.  Let us be perfect models for our youths to follow the path of Christ. Family is the Divine institution which is instituted by our Almighty God. Let us keep purity, love and healthy relationships in our family life.  May our Almighty God grant us wisdom to know how great our God and His deeds are.

In Christ's ministry,
