My Dear Parish Members,

As we are leaving Ebenezer Mar Thoma Church May 1st onwards , we take this opportunity to convey our heartfelt thanks to all our beloved and wonderful members of  Ebenezer family. It was a delightful experience to work and worship with you all over past two years as your vicar. I can't find perfect words to express  my overwhelming feelings of gratitude to everyone  for your prayers, support and kindness during our service period . We are enriched by your fellowship and association . We enjoyed well through  Christian communion . We are so painful to leave Ebenezer family but we are leaving with good memories in our minds. Thank you for your concern, sincerity and fellowship. April 30th Sunday is my last official service in Ebenezer MarThoma Church. I request everybody's presence on that day. We request your prayer for our continuing journey in Lord's ministry.

Goodbye and God bless you all!

With love and prayers,	

Sony Achen and Asha Kochamma
