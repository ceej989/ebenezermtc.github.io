_"I hereby command you: Be strong and courageous; do not be frightened or dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go"_ - Joshua 1:9 (NRSV)

Joshua was entrusted to lead the Israelites into the promise land without the leadership of Moses. As he recalled the challenges that he faced in the past, as he reflected on his own abilities, he probably felt that he was not capable of the task ahead of him. It was at this time that the word of the Lord came to him. The Lord’s words and the guarantee of the Lord’s presence enabled Joshua to go forward to accomplish what he had to do.

The reason that Joshua was not to be afraid or dismayed was because the Lord was going to be with him. This is similar to the experience of the disciples at the end of the Gospel of Matthew. Jesus told the disciple to go into the world and teach the people the word and will of God, making disciples of people from all nations. With the commission was the promise that _"I am with you always, to the end of the age"_ (Matthew 28:20).
            
We as Christians are called to believe in God and do the tasks that God has called us to do. This New Year we will all face trails and difficulties, but remember that God is with us. Remember that God will empower us. Remember faith does not make things easy, faith makes things possible.
