Our time on this earth is limited. First of all we must be very careful how we live on this earth because we have only limited time in our life. The Psalmist says "Show me O Lord my life's end and the number of my days. Let me know how fleeting is my life"(Psalm :- 39:4) So that we have to develop a spiritual wisdom to face the realities of life. Paul tells we must make the most of every opportunity. In every year we are getting lot of opportunity to be fruitful but how many of us are using it in right way.
	
Don't live in worries of tomorrows, we have to live in hope of today's moment. Many of us are living either in the sinful past or anxiety of future but the main important thing is how do we face life in present stage. Don't waste our time for shallow affairs. Many people  are wasting their time for wrong things. Main thing in our life is to understand the will of God. What do you think God's will for you in this new year? We have to set our priorities according to God's will. We should have definite time for prayer in our home and spend quality time with our family.  
	
How to form a happy and healthy new year? 
	"You will have enough trials to keep you strong.
	You will have enough sorrows to keep you human.
	You will have enough hope to keep you happy
	You will have enough failure you keep you humble
	You will have enough friends to give you comfort
	You will have enough enthusiasm to make you look forward to tomorrow
	You will have enough determination to make each day better than the day before.
Many of us may have enough wealth to meet the needs of others".	

What happened in the last twelve months? Was it a best year for us? We will get 8760 hours of this year. We have to use it wisely for the glory of God and to the extension of Kingdom of God. May Almighty give more strength more wisdom and more blessing in this Year
