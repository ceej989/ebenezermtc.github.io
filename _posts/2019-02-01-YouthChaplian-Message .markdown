_"Except the Lord build a house, they labor in vain that build it.  Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain."_ - Psalms 127:1

Our efforts are useless unless we do our work the way God wants us to do it.  In the about verse two importance aspects of human life are being addressed: establishing a house and who will protect us.  This verse shows us the importance of God being the main component in each of these aspects of our lives.

Often we feel that by our own abilities, we have accomplished great things.  We feel that by our abilities we have gain wealth and security.  But the above verse shows that without God, everything that we have acquired and those things that we put our trust in is vain or useless.  

It is the presence of God that gives us not only the security but also the peace that enables us to enjoy life.  In Proverbs 17:1 it is written, “Better is a dry morsel with quiet than a house full of feasting with strife.”  Having more is not always better.  Having more does not mean that we will have more enjoyment.  There are people who have a great deal of material wealth, but do not have peace or happiness.

Peace is not in the absence of trouble, but in the presence of God.  When God is the foundation of your life, the foundation of your house, and the One you trust to watch over your life, then you will have peace.                

Jesus Christ, told us that in this world, we will have problems.  But we are to be confident because He has overcome the world.  So we should build our lives and our homes the way God wants us to.  We should trust God to watch over us.  This will help give meaning to our lives and peace to our souls.
