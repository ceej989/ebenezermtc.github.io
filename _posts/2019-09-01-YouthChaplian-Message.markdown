Dearly beloved in Christ,

September is a special month for many of us.  Every first Monday of the month, we celebrate Labor Day.  Labor Day is a time in where we recognize the work force in America and their contribution for our country.  As God’s creation placed on this world to do work, we should know our responsibility to dedicate all that we are for God in the abilities God has blessed us with.  We are all blessed equally but uniquely.  God made us all unique in fulfilling His divine purpose for us.  It comes to us to understand what makes us unique and how we can submit our unique selves for the glory of God.  Proverbs 16:3 says “Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and he will establish your plans.”  As we exist in this world, how much are we willing to give our best for God in our existence on earth?  God gave His all for us.  We should also give all that we have for God.  It does not mean to be perfect, but to be the best ‘me’ that I can be.  Let us remember the hard work of all Americans throughout history till date.  Our country is blessed by the contribution of hard work.  Let us use this Labor Day to thank God for His wonderful providence and move forward and continue to strive.


The first Sunday of September our lectionary is commemorating as Education Sunday.  The theme is focused on teachers and that they should be filled with divine wisdom.  James 3 speaks on wisdom from above and below.  All can get wisdom.  But the wisdom that we get from above, filled with selflessness, love and compassion brings forth harmony for humanity.  As we teach the growing generation we should seek God for wisdom, to bring up humanity, and not just to acquire knowledge that only brings up the self and tries to put ‘I’ on the pedestal.  Let us pray for our teachers to teach to sharpen one another, hoping for the next generation to strive to be the best they can be for God.


Happy September to one and all.  God bless.




Much Love,

Jess Achen
