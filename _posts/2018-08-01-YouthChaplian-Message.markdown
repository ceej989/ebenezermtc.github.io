**The Lord is king!  Let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad!** – Psalms 97:1 NRSV


The psalmist who wrote this many years ago is affirming his faith that God’s reign is not limited to Israel.  
It extends all over the world.  This is a source of joy to all that believe in God.  But it is also a commandment to spread the word of God to the ends of the Earth. 


When we look at people who were faithful to God like Daniel, wherever they went they had faith in God and lived a life that glorified God.  By their life the people around them learned about God and what God expected from them. 

Romans 10:14-15 states,

But how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed?  And how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard?  And how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him unless they are sent?  As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”    


We are sent into the world to be the light and salt of the world.  By our life as we worship and rejoice in God, we are spreading the message that the world needs to hear.  The message that there is a God who loves us, cares for us, and is always with us.  This God wants to have a relationship with us.  This relationship requires us to live our life according to His will.  We are to glorify God in all that we do, so that they message of God can be spread to the ends of the world.
