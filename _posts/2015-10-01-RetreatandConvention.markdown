A friendly reminder on October 3rd, we will be having a 1 Day Retreat at our parish (406 King St, Port Chester, NY).  Also our annual 3-day convention is being held at our church from October 9th to the 11th.  Rev B Mathew (Vicar of St James MTC) will be our guest speaker on Friday and Saturday.  On Sunday, Mr Aby Cherian from St Thomas MTC will be our speaker.  The convention will start on both days at 7PM and on Sunday at 11:30 AM.  Worship service will be held at 9:30 AM on Sunday.
