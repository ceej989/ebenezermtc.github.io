_"Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, believe also in me”_ (John 14:1)

My beloved ones, Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

Someone said,” I don’t trust anybody; you can’t believe your own breath these days”. Another man said that he is not getting married because he had no faith in future. A third man saw nothing but ruin and despair everywhere. When we live with such a generation that has become desperate it is necessary to be aware of the infinite possibilities and miracle that faith can work.


It is faith that instills energy into us and gives us the zest to go forward. It is like fuel to a vehicle. Faith gives us the power to move forward to our goal. If only we dispel negative emotions like fear, jealous, suspicion, pessimism and over anxiety, we shall be able to prepare the background for the growth of faith. Positive thoughts are indispensable to faith. 


Faith can overcome failures and obstacles. A clear vision about our goals make faith stronger. Thomas Edison persevered despite all his failures in the making of electric lights. He kept on experimenting. It is unflagging faith and perseverance of this man that is behind the electric power now available to us. 


Martin Luther King Junior has shared his experience in faith with us. Life had been peaceful for him during the first twenty-four years of his life. But once he started fighting for the blacks, his life changed. With his leadership in the Montgomery bus strike his life fell under threat. King at first felt terribly frightened. At midnight one day he prayed with all his heart. He told God how he was at his wit’s end, having lost all his strength and courage. Yet his people were waiting for him to lead them. He surrendered himself at the Lord’s feet. At that moment he heard a voice asking him to stand firm for justice and to fight for truth. Never, till that moment had he strongly felt the divine presence. He felt empowered to face any difficult situation. His house was bombed three days later but he could face anything bravely and till the end of his life he fought for truth and justice. 


A man who had a lot of problems and crisis in his life was ever cheerful. He never grumbled or complained. Ever content, he offered hope and encouragement to his fellow beings. Even those who are blessed with health, wealth and high positions and honors do not seem to be content with their life. When a friend asked him what the secret of his success was, he gave a simple answer: Faith in God with whom he maintained a close relationship. The Almighty who controls everything and everybody was instilling joy and peace into his mind. The friend who heard him said that he too had faith in God but did not know how to relate to and to be in communion with God. Now the contented man explained to him how to relax and concentrate on the invisible power and to imagine that it is flowing in to him. He must yield to flow of the divine power, fervently praying for it. If he perseveres in it, he will succeed. 
We must cultivate the faith that God is there to lead us even in the darkness at noon and life is all covered by the clouds of despair. Such a faith can turn all our gloomy yesterdays into bright tomorrows. May God Almighty will help us all, Amen. 


With prayers and Blessings,
