Dearly Beloved in Christ,

We have come to the eleventh month of this year.  The weather is getting colder and it is a month that is very precious to us as Americans.  This month we as a country celebrate Thanksgiving.  I always look forward to this season with the great feast and the gathering of wonderful family and friends.  The first Thanksgiving was celebrated by the Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World in October of 1621.  It was a time when the pilgrims were thankful for the new world and the harvests of the seasons and being able to enjoy the fruits of their hard labor.  Looking into today’s time, of all the ways God journeys with us, enabling us as a migrant community and seeing the blessings of generations being born and raised here, how good our God is and how much He was with us every single step of the way.  Our first generation came to this country and started with nothing.  Look at now how much we prospered and be able to see the fruits of the labor.  We have to constantly realize God as the source of our blessings whether if we see it great or small.  With whatever we have, let us thank God for it.  Thanksgiving comes not just through words, but it is a constant act of appreciation that requires the ones who are thankful to be full of respect and love.  Every morning when we wake up, let us celebrate it as a thanksgiving and recall our blessings and name them one by one and also be agents to bless others around us.


This month we also celebrate World Sunday School Day.  Let us thank God for the life of Robert Raikes who started the Sunday School movement.  It once started as schools for working children in history’s past, and now it has become an institution to study God’s Word and teaching children about the Bible, the church and faith.  Let us continue to pray for the younger generation who are in Sunday School so that they can grow in faith and dedicate their lives to God.  Let us pray for those who are teaching in Sunday School for God given wisdom and a life that walks according to God’s will and constantly denying the desires of the flesh.


Wishing all of you a Happy Thanksgiving and a blessed November.



Much Love,

Jess Achen
