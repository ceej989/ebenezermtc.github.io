Dearly Beloved,
A good lent make space for hope by leading us afresh into encounter with the holiness of God. Human beings are made to live in relationship - Relationship with God, human beings and relationship with the whole creation. Here God calls us to respond His call positively. Listen what He wants to say and pay attention and to make straight the way. Listening is a difficult  process in life. In Lent we open the way of Hope that the world may see - We believe that Lent is a form of self - improvement. In a way it is right. But Lent is no mere individualistic, narcissistic and inward - looking self help festival. A good Lent must over flow in generosity. It is one of the signs. Takeout the bumps in the road, the bumps in the road we need to smooth out for the Lord to come. Relationships that have been neglected and there fore are full of clutter that needs removing?

Broken relationships may be easily mendable, little irritations or it may be that we need, in a good Lent, to take the first step to clearing away a major landslide. The practical ways are openness, transparency and treat each person and situation differently. Repair the relationship with the community. Zacchaeus , a tax collector received by Jesus makes a new relationship and he sorts himself out with God . His household will have been turned in to a place of hospitality rather than exhaustion. The discipline of a good Lent is to find again how we welcome the stranger, how we practice hospitality, how we listen. It is the eternal experience of the Church that God's word to us comes in surprising ways and from unusual, and very often in our eyes unimportant people.

The interaction of Church and Society is the foundation of a good Lent and a good Lent the foundation of a just society. Not a Lent of abstinence, but a Lent of listening to our vocation, to rejoicing with those for whom things are going well, to suffering with those left behind. A listening Lent is one of robust disagreement not bland assurance, but disagreement with a moral vision and destination. A good Lent starts with in us. It moves through those most closely around us - In practice, let us see whether together, we can not make a discipline of listening better; and perhaps in Churches gathering once or twice during Lent for a period of prayer, of silence, of confession, of dealing with bad relationships and of sharing a meal together. There we will find Jesus Christ. There the road will be made smoother. A GOOD LENT MAKES SPACE FOR THE PRESENCE OF GOD IN ALL.


MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL

Lovingly,
Sujan Achen
