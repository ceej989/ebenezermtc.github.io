Dear all,

This year's Junior-Senior Conference will take place at Ramapo College from July 7 to July 10, 2016.  Please announce during your announcements (both in the parish and Sunday school). 

This year's conference theme is Back to the Future with God - Jeremiah 29:11.  Attached is the conference health form which is very important because of new rules for camp inhabitants at Ramapo.  Also, something different this year is that we need to know who your chaperones are by mid June per NJ State rules.  Please ask them now so they can clear their schedules.  We will not be able to host our camp without this information this year.  I will send out the brochure separately and we will have the website up shortly.

CONFERENCE BOOK ART:  We are currently accepting original digital/scanned artwork that you have created, which tie into our theme "BACK TO THE FUTURE WITH GOD"  See website for details (same as last year).  Submission deadline is JUNE 10.

Thank you and please feel free to contact us if you have any concerns or questions.  I've also attached the HEALTH FORM.
