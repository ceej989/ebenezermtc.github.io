Dearly Beloved in Christ,

Most of us are facing times of trials especially with the pandemic of COVID-19.  When we look around us, it is obviously very discouraging, and we are to distance ourselves from people and social interactions are limited to only immediate family or on social media.  We are trying to see in what ways we can have the time pass and just overcome this horrible season.  But as children of God, we must be rest assured that God is in control of everything and He is with us, He will never leave us nor forsake us.  Especially in this time of lent and as we commemorate the passion of Christ through His death, burial and resurrection, we can see God the Father work through God the Son.  The Son had to suffer, but the suffering was to redeem the whole world.  We should look in that perspective on our suffering or circumstances of being uncomfortable.  We should be willing to push forward to be an instrument of God and be willing to go through uncertain circumstances.  When we look at the Apostle Paul, who was in chains and imprisoned, even though he was confined, He continued to live his life usefully to God.  As many of us are confined and self-quarantined, we should ask in what areas are we being useful to God and use the time to be more in His presence. 

Although this season is difficult for us, let us not be disheartened but have faith and trust in God. I advise all of you to minimize your time watching the news, but rather just be safe, stay home, practice good hygiene and spend time with the people around you.  It is a time to be closer to God and our immediate family.  Let us overcome this together with God as our ultimate destination. 

Let us pray for people who are suffering from this pandemic, let us especially pray for those who are in the healthcare field for safety and thank God for them for dedicating their lives for our wellbeing.  Kochamma and I are praying for you, and our love is always with you. 

Despite this situation, wishing all of you a blessed April and a Happy Resurrection Day. 


Much Love,

Jess Achen
