I read this illustration recently. A gentleman moved into a retirement community to spend the rest of his life there.  It wasn’t long until he had made a number of friends among the other residents. There was one lady he was especially attracted to, & she was attracted to him, also. So they spent a lot of time together. Finally one evening he proposed, asking her to marry him. The next morning he woke up remembering his proposal, but he couldn’t remember her answer. So he went to her & said, "I’m really embarrassed. I proposed to you last night but I can’t remember if you said 'Yes' or 'No." "Oh, thank goodness!" she replied. "I remembered saying `Yes’ but I couldn’t remember who asked me." Sometimes I feel that way about New Year’s resolutions.

Again we are on the verge of a new year and we renew our commitment and resolutions and we also take new decisions.  Some of us keep our decisions, some of us forget about it and some us struggle with our decisions. As a Christian how do we take our New Year decisions? What are the guiding forces behind our decisions? Why do we take all these decisions in life?. We have a lot of choices in front of us and many a time we are confused to go which way and to take what decisions. We don’t know what should be our parameters when we take our decisions. As Christians our life has to be examined constantly and needs to be corrected wherever needed. That is why we need to take more decisions and resolutions in life.

**Our decisions are to be based on kingdom values**

All the decisions that we take in lives should be based on the kingdom values. Paul says “For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, (Rom. 14.17). Jesus inaugurated this kingdom with these values and all who are His children should be in this Kingdom. When we are in the Kingdom we are under the rule of God with these values.  These values are related to our personal life, related to our relationship with the Lord and our relationship with our brothers and sisters who are co existing with us. If our decisions are not producing righteousness, peace and Joy in our lives and in the kingdom of God that we are in then our decisions are not based on the kingdom values. So in this New Year let us take our decisions based on the kingdom values.

**Our decisions should bring Glory to God**

Paul says in Romans. 15: 17 “Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God”. All the decisions that we take in our lives should bring glory to our God. Many a time we take decisions for our own sake and bring glory to our name. I believe, that is the difference that should happen when we take decisions as a Christian. All the decisions that we take should bring glory to God’s name and eventually that will turn righteousness, peace and Joy in the Holy Spirit in our lives. That is how we also receive blessings of our own decisions.

**Our decisions are carried out by the power of God**

As humans we are limited with our ability, knowledge and discernment. We need the power and grace of God to carry out all the decisions that we take.  If we depend on our own might and abilities we will be a failure in our lives. We need to completely depend on the grace of God to carry out all the decisions that we take in our lives. As Paul says “But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me”. Let us submit to this grace as we move to this New Year.

We wish you all a happy and blessed new year to bring kingdom values in our lives.
