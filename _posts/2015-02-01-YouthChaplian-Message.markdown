*...and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.* **(John. 10:16)**

One of the great visions that Jesus wanted to explain to His disciples is one Lord and one sheep. The oneness of Christians amidst of the diversities is the Lordship of Jesus. But many a time it became a force of division among Christians in the history. Even this was evident in the first century church where Paul asked the question ‘is Christ divided?’. When he was writing to the Ephesians Pau clearly explained what is the unity of Christians , “There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all”. (Eph. 4. 4,5) But most of the oneness that Paul is trying to emphasise in these verses became forces of division in the church.

Jesus is telling us today that every Christian is part of His flock and He is the only Lord. Chapter 10 describes this unique relationship a shepherd has with sheep for the unity. The shepherd owns, knows and gives life to these flocks. This is an intimate and unique relationship that a shepherd is having with his sheep. All the sheep have the privilege to believe that there is someone who owns them, knows them and gives life in abundance and that is their shepherd. This intimate relationship should be the catalyst for our unity in Christ. We are one in Christ. John Chapter 10 also talks about the unique characteristics of the sheep who is part of this unity. They listen to the shepherd and will not listen to any other false shepherds because they recognise the voice of the shepherd. They know the shepherd and enter through the gate of Jesus for the salvation. They have no confusions on what they believe and who are the right prophets. Jesus clearly warns about the false teachers and heresies that can come on our way when we live in this world. If we don’t listen and know our shepherd then we will easily fall into the trap of division and hatred. Jesus said we will discern the false prophets by their fruits. So teachings and the fruits are to go hand in hand. The question is do we listen to our shepherd and shepherd alone? Do we know Him personally?

All the diversities that we have among Christianity should not be the forces of division and hatred among us but should a unifying force because we have only one Lord. But today it is sad to understand that a lot hatred and division is in the Christian community on what we believe and what we practice. The best answer to find a solution to these divisions is to listen to our shepherd and not be cheated by the false teachings. Let us know him personally then the diversities that we have is a blessing in our growing together. Let us enter through the gate of our Lord and He said ‘I am the gate’.
