Dearly Beloved In Christ,

The suffering of this world is inescapable. In our suffering we cry out to God and seek His love. As Christians we call out and challenge him when he seems not to answer.  The psalmist does the same. Humility saves human in Gods eyes, while pride is a loser. The heart of a humble person is open. It accepts correction and trust in God. The heart of the proud person is the exact opposite. It is arrogant, closed, knows no shame. It is impervious to God's voice. People's of God posses the three characteristics of humility, poverty and the trust in the lord. Those who do not accept correction, they do not trust in the lord. They will be contemned these people cannot receive  salvation. They are closed to salvation.

Poverty is a privileged gift that opens the door to the mystery of God. People who were not interested in the truth, who sought only their own interests and went where the wind blow. You should go this way, you should go that way, and they were weathervanes, all of them! All of them! Without consistency. A heart without consistency, so they negotiated everything, they negotiated interior freedom, they negotiated the faith, negotiated their country everything except appearances. To such people, getting the best out of every situation was the important thing. They were opportunities. They profited from the situations.

The observant people very secure in their habits. It’s true but only in appearance. They were strong, but on the outside.  They were in a cast the heart was very weak, they don't know what they believed. And because of this, their life the outer part of their life was completely regulated but the heart and a skin that was plastered over, strong, harsh, Jesus on the other hand teaches us that Christian should have a strong heart, a firm heart, a heart built on the rock that is Christ, and then in the way it goes out it goes out with prudence. " In this case, I do this: but it is the way of going out but: the heart is not negotiable, the rock is not negotiable. The rock is Christ. It is not negotiable. Jesus never negotiates, his heart of the son of the father, but he was so open to the people seeking paths to help them. But this can't be done our discipline, our doctrine say this can't be done! They say. Why do your disciples eat grain in the fields, when they travel on the day of the Sabbath?. It can't be done! They were so rigid in their discipline. "No the discipline can’t be touched it's sacred. Jesus denounces hypocrisy and opportunism.

 

Humility saves human in God's eyes, while pride is a loser.

**WISH YOU A HAPPY BLESSED NEW YEAR.**

*Do not forget that in life, nothing remains unchanged and everything evolves through transformation. You must learn how to evaluate every situation with the correct amount of modesty. If you are living a moment of success, re-dimension your enthusiasm; If on the other hand you are waiting for a development be patient; everything turns and re-news itself.*
