*So   I went  down to the potter's house ,and there he was  working  at  his  wheel.  The  vessel he  was making  of  clay  was  spoiled  in  the potter's  hand,  and he  reworked  it  into  another  vessel, seemed  as good  to  him (Jeremiah  18: 3,4)*

It is the story of  potter and the clay, really it is the story of God and human being. How  is the birth of  a vessel is happening?

Five different stages of a pot:
1. Unrefined stage
2. Liquid stage
3. Dry stage
4. Firing stage
5. Glazing stage

Dear believers in Christ, 

All these stages  have similarity with human life. The word  marred  means  decayed, ruined,   corrupted, spoiled, disfigured, wasted. Nation of  Israel is  in a  doomed  stage,  but  through the prophet Jeremiah  God gives them another chance. Today also God is still at the potter's wheel , are ready to rework your life into something wonderful. The potter has a purpose and vision , with every touch potter is forming and transforming  you  into  a  vessel  of  honor  and  beauty.  

As a  clay we  should  be  fully  dedicated  and fully  loyal  to  the  potter.  Our  stubborn  nature , lack of  dedication  and  our own will   instead of  God's  will  will not  create  a  perfect vessel .  God needs  complete surrender from  human side  to  become a  beautiful  vessel.  If you  are  not  shaped up to  divine  will , the  reason is you have  not  committed  perfectly  to  divine  will

God  told  Jeremiah  to get up  and  go to  the potter's  house because Nation of Israel was in a crisis, not a financial crisis it was a spiritual crisis .  The nation that belong to God , blessed by  God  but  forgotten God .  God is not on their center of  lives. Potter's  hand is  skilled , purposeful and loving  hands . God  can change  any  clay. God could change  Joseph into co commander over Egypt . Captive like Daniel turned to a prayer warrior. Shepherd boy David turned to King  of Israel. Child  like Jeremiah  turned to  great  Prophet. Fisherman Peter turned to  great  apostle. By the touch of  Master's  hand  all the imperfections will be gone. He is  a God  of new beginning  and  second  chances . Let us be a meaningful change in our circumstances for the extension of  Kingdom of God.  May Almighty God  bless all our summer activities for a  meaningful  Christian fellowship.
