Dearly Beloved in Christ,

As we face the last month of the year 2020 let us be thankful to God for His faithfulness.  Even as we went through uncertain and tough times, God has been always faithful, and He is always good.  Let us continue to praise His name and uphold in prayer for the new year 2021.  

December is the time of the advent season; we as a church are commemorating the 25-day Lenten period leading up to the feast of the Church known as the Feast of Nativity (Christmas Day).  Luke 2:11 says “Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; He is the Messiah, the Lord.”  During Christmas time we usually see a few words and even use them as Christmas decorations, words such as Noel, Joy, and Emmanuel.  All these words point to the truth of the source of joy and happiness as we reflect on Jesus as Emmanuel: God with us.  As we close this year recognized by the challenges of the pandemic, Let us reflect on the truth that at the end of this month, and always, God is still with us, he will never leave us, nor forsake us.  God incarnate as man is the reality of hope, love, and purpose instilled in us.  C.S. Lewis once said: “Once in our world, a stable had something in it that was bigger than our whole world.”  God is much bigger than this world, and all that this world consists of, including its problems and challenges.  Let us on this Christmas season encourage one another to never rely on ourselves, but rather we should fully submit to God and rely upon all that we are on Him.

Wishing all of you a Merry Christmas and a blessed and happy New Year 2021! Bless and be blessed.


Much Love,

Jess Achen
