_"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."_ - 2 Timothy 2:15 (KJV)
 
For so many children, now is the time that they return to their studies.  When the summer begins, they put their books aside and try to “enjoy their vacation.”  But there is one book that we can never lay aside, and that book is the Bible.  The Bible provides us with history, poetry, prophecy, and doctrine. 


The Bible teaches us about a person’s relationship to God and to each other.   The Bible teaches us about God’s love for us and His purpose for us.  The Bible teaches us how we can obtain salvation by believing in God and living a life that is in accordance with God’s will.   Even though there are parts of the Bible that are thousands of years old, the message of the Bible is still relevant today.   The Bible provides us with instructions for how to live our life.
 
Someone once said that Bible stands for:  

*B*asic

*I*nstructions

*B*efore

*L*eaving

*E*arth
 
Though we are all busy with so many things, we should always make time for the important things.  We should always remember that our life here is temporary and one day we will have to give an account of our life.  By the Grace of God may we all live our life in accordance with God’s will.
