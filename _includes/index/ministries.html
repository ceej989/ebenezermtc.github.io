                    <h4>Edavaka Mission</h4>
                    <p>
                        The spiritual renewal in the Church, which was the offspring of reformation has created a yearning in believers to present the Gospel to others. It was realized that this could not be fully achieved by the services of a few full time evangelists. On the other hand every member of the Church should be a missionary filled with such joy and assurance of salvation as to be Christ’s witness to those who come into contact with him, irrespective of one’s profession in secular life.Believers interested in evangelistic and intercessory activities used to assemble periodically for prayer and fellowship. It was in the annual meeting of such a gathering in 1924, the present Mar Thoma Voluntary Evangelists’ Association was formed. Bishop Abraham Mar Thoma was the ardent supporter of this movement.The objective of this association is that every member of the Church should be a witness to Jesus Christ, whatever his or her occupation may be. Those who volunteer to be members of the Association meet together in each parish at least once a week for fellowship, intercessory prayer, Bible study and sharing experiences.The branch of the Mar Thoma Voluntary Evangelists Association in the Parish is called "Edavaka Mission".

                            The women in the Mar Thoma church also shared the spiritual power generated by the Reformation. The Mar Thoma Suvisesha Sevika Sangham the women’s wing, was inaugurated during the Maramon Convention in the year 1919, under the leadership of Abraham Mar Thoma Suffragan Metropolitan, who gave the Sangham continued support and inspiration.
                            Every women of the Mar Thoma Church above the age of 18 years is a member of the Sevika Sangham. The Sevika Sangham has branches in all parishes of the Mar Thoma Church both in India and abroad. The Sevika Sangham at Ebenezer Mar Thoma Church is an extremely active and spirited group who play an extremely active role in the development and growth of our church.

                        <h4>Sunday School</h4>
                        <p>
                            In the Mar Thoma Church, Sunday Schools play a very significant role in the spiritual renewal and growth of young generation. The formal inauguration of the Sunday School Samajam took place at Maramon Convention in 1905. 'Come to Jesus and bring every child to Jesus' is the motto of our Sunday school. Since then the Sunday School organization has grown and changed but our motto still remains the same.Ebenezer Mar Thoma Church Sunday School is held every Sunday (with some exception) between September and June at 11:00am. It is comprised of an extremely dedicated team of teachers and an eager group of students who have led to its continued success year after year. Our students actively participate in Diocesan-led initiatives such as the National Diocesan Exam and VBS. In addition to bible study, our students also learn about church history and the growth of the Mar Thoma Church.

                        <h4>Youth Fellowship and Yuvagena Sakhyam</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Mar Thoma Yuvajana Sakhyam was organized with a view that all the young people in the Church should accept Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, and bear witness to His saving power. It was organized in 1933 by a resolution of the Sabha Prathinidhi Mandalam. Ebenezer Mar Thoma Church continues to honor this resolution with not only an active and thriving Yuvajana Sakhyam but also an extremely devoted Youth Fellowship group. Both groups work hand in hand to develop our youth as responsible young men and women who can face the challenges of life while upholding the faith and practices of the Mar Thoma Church and Christian values.
