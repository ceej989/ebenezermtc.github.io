Our Senior Suffragan Metropolitan and the first resident Bishop of the Diocese of North America and Europe, Dr. Zacharias Mar Theophilus Suffragan Metropolitan is taken to his Masterâ€™s glory today at 5.52 pm at KIMS hospital Trivandrum. The Mar Thoma Church deeply mourns the unexpected and sudden demise of the Senior Suffragan Metropolitan Rt. Rev. Dr. Zacharias Mar Theophilus Thirumeni. The mortal remains of Tirumeni will be brought to Tiruvanathapuram Pattoor Church and will be kept there till 8pm (IST) today for public viewing and then brought to Tiruvalla. On the way to Tiruvalla the body will be kept at Tittamel Church Chengannoor. The funeral service will be held on Tuesday 10 am at the S.C. S. Church, Tiruavlla.
Please remember the services we received from our Tirumeni and give thanks to God for his blessed life. It is a great loss for our Church and for the entire Christian community.
Let us uphold our Church and its leadership as we go through this time of mourning.
