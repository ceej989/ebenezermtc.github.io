Greetings in the name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,

The Mar Thoma Church is apostolic in origin, universal in nature, biblical in faith, evangelical in principle, ecumenical in outlook, oriental in worship, democratic in function and episcopal in character.

Our Church is part of the One, Holy, catholic and apostolic Church. The spiritual life our Church members is nurtured through worship, ministry of the Word and through administration of the sacraments. As a reformed and global Church our emphasis should be on living the Gospel through our life and witness. Our spirituality is nurtured through personal devotion and family worship. People are becoming more secular, technocratic and materialistic,so it is our great challenge to keep the people on the strong foundation of the Rock and keep them in Kingdom values.

On coming days as a parish we have many activities as per our program calendar- all programs are for the spiritual growth of our Church. I pray that these programs may be a medium to strengthen our faith and enrich our relationship in Christ. Let us submit ourselves for the Glory of The God. Let our prayer be like this: "Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven". May the great love of God build us together, the Grace of Christ strengthen us and the guidance of the Holy Spirit lead us now and for ever.

In Christ's ministry,

Sony Achen
