Dear Believers in Christ,

We are called as covenant community, to be different and distinctive in our mission. Deliberate effort is necessary to sustain identity of covenant community. Our liturgy creates new consciousness to lead covenantal lifestyle, through liturgy we are claiming our identity  as people of God. Our festivals demand different way of life for people of God. How to keep covenant identity in the midst of bad influences of cultures? How to proclaim alternative lifestyle through different way of life as people of God? But now a days our identity is breaking or shattering through different cultural influences.

Let us keep our roots and identity as the people of new covenant community. We should have act of resistance and witnessing to sustain identity of people of God. What kind of lifestyle we are constructing as people of God? Let us examine ourselves. Shall we dream and work towards a social order based on God's love. Reformation has imbibed bible culture into our life ie; centrality of scripture in our lifestyle. Let us be rejuvenated and revitalized through scripture oriented lifestyle.

God's love is transforming, uniting, and empowering so shall we try to be true transmitters of God's love as covenant people. The very existence of covenant community should be enlighted  presence for the salvation of whole Universe. Dear believers, let us pray and participate in all upcoming events of Parish . Let us look back to history and praise God, remember the ways tha Lord led us. What we gained is not the issue but what we gave for the blessing of the world is the criterion of covenant community.

May Almighty God empower us now and forever.

In Christ's ministry,
