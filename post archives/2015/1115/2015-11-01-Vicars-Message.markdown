* The child grew and became strong in spirit.filled with wisdom and grace of God was upon Him.Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with God and men* (Luke 2:52)

Dear Believers in Christ,

This month we are giving more importance to our children by celeberating world sunday school day.As we know they are gift of God.What are the important aspects essential for the growth of child. Infant Jesus grew up physically and spiritually and filled with wisdom and grace of God.He grew up in wisdom and age keeping proper relation with God and humanity.What is the essential criterion for well balanced growth. Our children are growing in different kind of situations and challenges that creates negative and positive impacts. If we need strong scriptural foundation for our children we should have serious approach to sunday school, any growth without Divine wisdom is incomplete.our sunday school creates more space for getting Divine wisdom. Balenced growth of child includes physical,mental.intellectual & spiritual dimensions. But many people avoiding spiritual dimension that is very dangerous.

Do we have exemplary family life? Let us examine ourselves, through proper parenting let our children be fruitfull to God, Church, and society at large.  Good parenting is key factor in child's growth.  Parents should have firm faith and absolute trust in God.  Our House should be a miniature church where prayer, worship, Bible reading, meditation, and lovely discussions should take place.  Where we teach God fear,values,hospitality,ethics,respect for tradions,older people,patriotism social responsibilities etc. So our primary responsibility to bring every child to our Lord Jesus Christ

This month we have sunday school day, family sunday, family night, thanksgiving, and Ecumenical sunday. Let all our celebrations be for glory of our almighty God.  These are the days of remeberence, repentence, and thanks giving.  What a marvelous ways God guided and protected us.  Let us continue our spiritual journey with almighty for the extension of kingdom of God.

In Christ's ministry,
