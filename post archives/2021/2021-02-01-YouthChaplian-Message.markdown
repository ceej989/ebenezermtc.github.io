Dearly Beloved in Christ,

As we enter the second month of this year, it is indeed incredibly special to us.  We as a Church hold February significantly in our lives as the Mar Thoma Church holds the Maramon Convention every year at this period.  This year we are still having Maramon Convention with COVID protocols.  Let us prayerfully participate that this year’s convention can be a blessing in all our lives to introspect and mold our lifestyle to the ways God guides us.

This month, February 14 is a significant day, especially for this particular year.  It is where 3 occasions come together.  We are celebrating Valentine’s Day, it is the first day of the Great Lent, and the convention.  Valentine’s Day is a celebration of love, the great symbol of love on this day is the “heart”.  As a church, we also are embarking on the journey through the Great Lenten period, which enables us to know the passion and love of God through the great symbol of the cross.  As Christians, let us uphold the cross in our minds as the symbol of love because Christ showed unconditional love on the cross.  Being called children of God, we should look unto God the source of love so that we can love one another just as much, valuing others above ourselves just as Christ values us before Him.

Let us use this Lenten period to discipline our selfish ways and have it become a means to guide ourselves to sharpen our lives to be more useful to God in love and obedience to Him.

As the regional youth fellowship, we have started the College Ministry Bible Study on zoom is on every Tuesday at 8 pm EST.  encourage the college students wherever they are to set time apart this hour and come together in online fellowship and devotion to God’s word.

May the love of God abide with us all.  Wishing everyone a blessed February.




Much Love,

Jess M George Achen
