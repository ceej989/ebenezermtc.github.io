Dearly Beloved in Christ,

As we embark on the fourth month of this year, completing our Lenten journey, let us continue to embrace our discipline throughout the Lenten period as a dedication for our life’s journey. We should continue to rededicate ourselves just as Christ unconditionally dedicated Himself for all of us. This month according to the lectionary we are looking into the life and ministry of Jesus Christ after the resurrection. The first week after Easter, we are meditating on St. Thomas’ honest faith that led him from doubt to strongly claim Jesus Christ as “My Lord and My God”. The second week after Easter, we are meditating on Jesus Christ as the one who restores. The final week of the month we are meditating on the hospitality of Jesus Christ specifically looking into the journey to Emmaus.

Throughout the weeks after the celebration of the Resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we are to embrace the mark Christ implanted on the disciples, and that same mark is to be with us. To embrace the life of Jesus, to love as He did, to keep our focus in life that is set on Him. We should also be the leaders that guide others towards the direction of God, especially through our availability and hospitality.

This month is also a painful month for our region as many of our Achens are transferring back to India. Let us thank God for the ministry of our priests who served our parish for the last few years and pray for the new chapters in their lives.

Kindly reminding our youths that on Holy Saturday (April 3 @ 10 AM) there is the Spring One Day Conference on the ZOOM platform. The speaker is our former youth chaplain Rev. Shibi Abraham, please come and participate. Along with that, every Tuesdays there are the College Ministry Bible Study on the ZOOM platform at 7 PM.

May the love and Peace of our Resurrected Lord and Savior Jesus Christ be with all of us now and forevermore.

Christ is Risen! Indeed, He is Risen! Amen.


Much Love,

Jess M George Achen
