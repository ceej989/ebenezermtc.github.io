Dear Believers in Christ,

Mission is both being and doing. Main agenda of God's mission is proclamation and promotion of the Kingdom of God as taught and lead by Christ. God's Mission begins in this world by creation, so retain created order is our main mission. Instead of word mission, the word witness is used in the Bible. the witnessing is always answerable , accountable and vulnerable . Witnessing really denotes the meaning of martyr hood 
	
Mission is understood in different ways as liberation , as humanization , as proclamation of Kingdom of God as development, as  dialogue , as building up of the community , as healing presence in a broken world . In a pluralistic contest our mission should be a  Christian presence . Mission is not crusade , conquest or colonialism for Christ , it should be Christian presence or a healing presence. It has to be revealed in our witnessing life. So Christian presence means not a threatening presence , it is a healing , reconciling and life giving presence.

Mission is for the maintenance of broken creation, reorder the fragmentation of humanity and heal the imbalanced relationship . God is not a private property , He is the God  all universe . When we confess Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior in the light of our faith , experience and tradition that means  we should express compassion , justice and love of Jesus through our  witness . So Christian mission is an empowerment for weaker section . 

Our mission and witness  needs transformed life style by Gospel . Early Christianity was a movement characterized  by conviction and commitment. We observe great Lent  now a days . We know it will conclude with Easter festival. it is the day of resurrection and celebration of Life over evil forces. Let all our Lent observation lead us to meaningful Christian witness and mission oriented life style. May almighty Lord bless all of us  by His Resurrected and comforting presence.  



With love and prayers,
