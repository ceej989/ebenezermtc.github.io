What is our identity ?  The identity makes one different and unique in the society. Our life is given but identity is our own creation. A Christian is challenged to construct identity by seeking a model from the Qurbana.  We cannot properly  receive the Bread of life without sharing the Bread for life of others. The Eucharistic  Sacrament  is Prophetic symbol which demands to us  as a Qurbana  community we should do dream of God for Just centered community , receive Body of Christ needs personal conversion and structural reforms. The purpose of Eucharist is to create a hope for an alternative community . 
	
The focus of Qurbana is a new humanity in Christ and loving community based on God's justice. Every Qurbana celebration is a Prophetic call to transform ourself and or society in the view of Kingdom of God.  Lord's Table remembers us  we are the keepers of the brother. Eucharist is a nourishment in our faith journey especially for those who seek Kingdom justice and peace. Is our Eucharist experience is a questionable one? Is it a passive  acceptance with injustice ,hostility and divisions

Table fellowship needs an actualization of community feeling and togetherness , building a community means  building relationship in a world of  divisions and alienation . So let us heal all our wounded relationship. Sharing table means sharing life for egalitarian society. Eating is symbol of fellowship . Jesus uses the meal as a sign and table as expression of solidarity. So we set Lord's Table without  race, culture, ethnicity and social status Qurbana is a mighty movement or dynamic force in the history for personal societal liberation. This movement demands freedom from all kinds of sinful bondages . Eucharist is a great school of peace forming men and women. 

As believer of this Church we should express a Qurbana centered identity or lifestyle for the extension of Kingdom of God. As we  have entered into Great Lent season let us practice lifestyle of Qurbana for a meaningful Christian witness. All our Lent prayers ,Namaskasra prarthanas, fasting and all other practices be a fruitful one to become new creation in Christ . May Almighty God Bless each one of us to be blessing for others.


With love and prayers,
