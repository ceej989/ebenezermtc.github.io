Hi everyone,

We are so excited to start our Christian Book Club series this **Saturday, June 3, 2017**. Our first meeting will be held at church at 11am. Tim Keller’s Every Good Endeavor: Connecting Your Work to God's Work is the first book of our series. The book is available for purchase through Amazon. Please make every effort to purchase the book before our second meeting, which will be held on June 17. We recommend purchasing the book so that you can learn and fully engage in discussions. We will be discussing chapters biweekly; thus, it is not necessary to read the book in its entirety before our first meeting. We look forward to seeing all those who are 18 years of age and older—join us for discussion and fellowship this Saturday. Please pass the word along and invite family members and friends who are of appropriate age. Light refreshments will be served.
