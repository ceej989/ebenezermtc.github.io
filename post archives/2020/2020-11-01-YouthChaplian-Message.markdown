Dearly Beloved in Christ,

Time has flown by fast and we are already in the eleventh month of the year. The hot weather is no longer here, and we must brace ourselves to the cold temperatures. Let us continue to hold one another in prayer to be kept safe and well. November is the time where we as a Church recognize the work of the Sunday School ministry as November 1st is World Sunday School Day. Let us continue to pray for the ministry of the Sunday School and have it a great avenue for the young ones to know God at a personal level. The Church also celebrates November 1st as Kudosh Eetho, the sanctification of the Church. When we look at the definition of sanctification, it is “the action of making or declaring something holy”. In our Qurbana liturgy in the elevation part, it is said by the celebrant, “Holy things for holy people”, what does the people respond? “Holy is the One Father, Holy is the one Son and Holy is the One living Holy Spirit”. This is one of many examples that reminds us that in order live a sanctified life, we should understand we are imperfect and need to focus our whole selves to God who is only perfect. To have a Holy Church, we should first make sure our home is sanctified through having it a space where we know God is the central focus. A God centered home builds a God centered Church.

We as a community are saddened by the loss of our spiritual father the Late Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma Metropolitan. The church is blessed indeed by his leadership and love. Let us thank God for Joseph Mar Thoma Thirumeni’s life and servanthood zeal. This month on November 14th, our church will install Theodosius Thirumeni as the new metropolitan. Let us remember His Grace in our prayers and wish him all God’s wisdom and blessings.

On November 28th at 10am the North East Regional Youth Fellowship will have a virtual Fall One Day/ Regional Leadership Conference. ALL our youths must register and participate. I want each church to spread the word and dear parents, please make sure your child is free to attend it. Details will be given by the regional youth secretary.

Wishing everyone a blessed November. God bless all of you.

Much Love,

Jess Achen
