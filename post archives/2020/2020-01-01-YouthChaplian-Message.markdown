Dearly Beloved in Christ,

We are at a beginning of not only a new year, but also a new decade. As a Christian, as we embark a new year it is important for us to have the desire to change certain aspects of our lives that takes us away from our journey with God and to see in what ways we can submit to the will of God more. Let that be the goal for this New Year. We are all getting older and not younger, therefore as time progresses, maturity for the same is something to always meditate on and we should be all God wants us to be rather that what we just want for ourselves.

This month in our lectionary, especially to dedicate ourselves to God for the New Year, we commemorate January 12 as Temperance Day: honor our body as the Temple of the Living God. P. T. Barnum was once asked when he was giving an address, "How does alcohol affect us, externally or internally?" Barnum responded "Eternally.” As we meditate on temperance, let us look into not just alcohol, but our selfish desires and emotions and see if it is align with God’s desires. It is a process to dedicate our whole being and deny ourselves and be all that God wants

us to be. We should ask ourselves the question; do we respecting ourselves as well as those around us understand we are the dwelling place of God? This requires us to look at what goes in and out of our bodies. No matter what we do, we should communicate the goodness of God as our joy and resting place. We cannot do this alone. It is a relationship we grow in God that enables us to desire His mind and His ways. Philippians 4:13 states the famous words that we can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Even if it not popular, or if it is a challenge to live for God, let us journey with God and grow in His love and communicate that love to the world around us.

Wishing all of you a blessed New Year 2020


Much Love,

Jess Achen
