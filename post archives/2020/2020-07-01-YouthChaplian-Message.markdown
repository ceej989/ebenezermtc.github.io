Dearly Beloved in Christ,

July is an important month for the American people.  On July 4th, we are celebrating the 244th Independence Day.  Let us praise God for our country and pray for our leaders and the people within to live in peace and harmony.  It is important for each of us to pray for peace and love as we are seeing our nation in crisis regarding racism.  Let us all fight hate within ourselves and then our homes first and from there move forward with living out love and have people know who God is.  God makes people of different shades and colors because in His eyes it is all beautiful.  God creates to show and express His love.  He expects all of humanity to love each other likewise and embrace the differences that we all have with one another as it fulfills God’s unique and beautiful design and will.  For us humans, there is one race and that is the race of being God’s children created in His image.  If we discriminate or feel uncomfortable because of color or ethnical background, we are in our hearts and actions putting down the image of God.  Let us work together to love one another unconditionally, looking unto God the source of love.  If we want to love God wholeheartedly, we must love His beautiful creation.  St. Matthew 25:45 clearly says, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’  The love we give for humanity is the love we give to our creator God.  Let us all pray for God’s peace and love to fill us so we can share it in the world we live in.


On July 3rd we are commemorating St. Thomas Day as it recognizes the Apostle to India, St. Thomas.  Although he was known as doubting Thomas, that was not his character, he should be known as honest Thomas.  He grew out of his doubts and acknowledged Christ as “My Lord and My God” (St. John 20:28).  Let us also learn from the strengths and weaknesses of St. Thomas and give all our doubts and uncertainty to God and continue to grow in our faith.  


Wishing all of you a Happy Independence Day!


Much Love,

Jess Achen
