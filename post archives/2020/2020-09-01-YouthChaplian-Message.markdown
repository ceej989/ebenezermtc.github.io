Dearly Beloved in Christ,

As we embark the ninth month of the year, we can all understand that coming up to this point, it was not at all a comfortable journey. It was tough, very tough. The world is upset and disturbed by the various events that took place in only the matter of months. It is hard for many of us to put into words or express how we would feel because many different events happened in such a short period of time. The world was already frustrated with the lockdown and social distancing measures and to top that off, we see racial tensions, weather calamities and violence throughout the world. To watch the news now is just mentally and emotionally exhausting. This is where we must look unto ourselves and see where we are in our faith. To be at peace is to continuously connect with God. the world is distracting us, but God’s love and peace can fill us with comfort and strength to move forward in hope. When we look at Acts 7:54-60, we see the scenario where Stephen was being stoned. The members of the Sanhedrin were furious and gnashing their teeth at Stephen. All around Stephen was hate and rejection. He had a choice to focus on that and be discouraged, even while he was facing his death at that moment, Stephen did not focus on what was happening all around him, rather he was filled with the Spirit and saw the heavens open and saw the glory of God and he was at peace. He was comforted and he responded with hope while enduring pain and hate by saying “Lord, do not hold this sin against them”. Yes, no matter how difficult it is, we also should not be discouraged by the unrest evil this world is throwing our way but continue to focus on God each step of the way. The more we focus and turn to Him, we can trust Him more. The more we look around us, the disturbances, we tend to forget the glory, power, and authority of God. Let us use our time to be closer to God, and our families and friends and together instill God’s peace on us so that we can share that peace and love with the world around us. Never be discouraged, love and have hope. We are God’s agents of love and peace. May God continue to use us.

Let God guide us this new month, God bless us all.

Much Love,

Jess Achen
