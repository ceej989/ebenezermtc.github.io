Dearly Beloved in Christ,

As we embark on the halfway point of the year 2020, let us also reflect halfway through this year, especially the plans we have made in the beginning of the year and how everything has been changed drastically. It calls to remind us that we can make any plan we want, but at the end of the day, we have our limitations and not everything we plan will go the way we desire it to happen. It also calls us to realize that we are not aware of what the future holds. Majority of the world is now living in fear because of the uncertainty of life and the future we have in this world. In the uncertainty that is limiting us as human beings, are we giving our uncertainties to our God who is certain? Do we trust God with our future, or are we depending on ourselves? We do not know what the future holds, but that does not mean we should be children without hope. We should give all that we are to God, whether if it is our plans, we should ask God “Lord, is my plans Your plans? Is my time Your time? Are my ways Your ways? Many of our life events are cancelled or being postponed because of the pandemic, but we should not worry about it, but be on our knees more and give it all to God who cares for us. 1 Peter 5:7- “Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.” If our ways, plans, and time belongs to God, it helps us to not worry because God’s plans are greater and more perfect. He has it all covered in His way and if we submit to His ways, we know that His plans are much more perfect than our plans. Proverbs 19:21 clearly states: “The human mind may devise many plans, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will be established.” Let us use this time to grow in our trust in God who is always by our side.

June is also a month of graduation. Many of our own youths are completing a milestone in their life in academia whether if it is middle school, high school, undergrad and even grad school. Some are moving onto the next step of academics, and there are some who will say sayonara to the education system. Nevertheless, to the wonderful graduates, young and old, never forget your roots and never be full of pride. You may excel well in this world, but it is by God’s grace alone. The abilities you have sharpened throughout the years of education, use it to glorify and bring up God’s Kingdom. God is not calling you to be successful, He is calling you to be faithful. Your church community is immensely proud of you. On behalf of my wife and I, congratulations and hats off!


Much Love,

Jess Achen
