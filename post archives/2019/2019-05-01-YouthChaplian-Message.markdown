Dearly beloved in Christ,

It is my great pleasure to be in New York once again, but now as an ordained priest and your Youth Chaplain.  Justeena Kochamma and I are excited and looking forward to reconnect with all of you.


This month is very special as it holds two important days.  One is Mother’s day and the other is Memorial Day.  Mothers are special and influential people in our life that impact us and bring us up to who we are today.  It is the love and care as well as a warm embrace of our mothers that enables us to see the mirror of the love of our most loving God.  As we commemorate our Mothers this month, let us look back at our lives and remember the tearful prayers and struggles our mothers went through in order to provide the comfortable life we have now.


As we commemorate Memorial Day, we remember the fallen soldiers who fought for our country.  Let us remember the families who once waited for their loved ones to return home, but instead see a soldier bearing the sad news that their loved one had departed.  It is a great sacrifice our armed forces make to fight for our freedom, risking their own lives.


This month in these two important holidays, as we remember our mothers and soldiers, let us remember them and the Christ likeness lifestyle imbedded in them.  How are we willing to make ourselves uncomfortable through our humility so that others can increase?  Do we have the willingness to be all that we are and risk all that we have for building up God’s kingdom?

Much Love,

Jess Achen
