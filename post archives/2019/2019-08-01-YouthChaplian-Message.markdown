Dearly beloved in Christ,

We have reached the eighth month of the year.  Looking back, we often wonder how time flies too fast.  For most students summer is over and it’s time to go back to school.  Some are excited, most are not.  But it is a reality that we have to face and it is a time for us to equip ourselves, understand the talents that God has blessed us with, and endures all that we have for Him.  Jesus said to the blind man Bartimaeus in Mark 10 “what do you want me to do for you?’.  He wanted to see.  Jesus immediately gave him sight and Jesus understood Bartimaeus’ heart as faithful and loyal.  We are pursuing many things that we desire, but where is our heart at?  Are we faithful to God?  In everything that we are called to do, at the present moment, let us all understand to do everything faithfully.  Even if it is being a student.  Let God work through us, so that we can prepare our lives to be all that God wants us to be and do all that God wants us to do.  Remember, Christians are called to be faithful, not successful.


For our motherland, this month is special as India celebrates her 72nd Independence Day.  Let us thank God that India was a true model for peaceful demonstration of gaining Independence through Mahatma Gandhi and by that, also enlightening peace towards freedom through civil rights activist Late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  Let us remember history’s past and be thankful for the journey that God had provided us thus far.  Although India celebrates Independence, there are a lot of people struggling without clean water, poor living habits, along with that, many are lost and not knowing the message of the Gospel.  As we celebrate India’s independence, let us deeply pray for her.


Hope this month is a blessing to all, all the best for all going back to school.  God is always with you.  He will never leave you.  Just make sure, you do not leave God.



Much Love,

Jess Achen
