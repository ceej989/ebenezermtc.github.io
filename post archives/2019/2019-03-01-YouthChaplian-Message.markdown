This year March 3rd marks the beginning of the Great Lent for the Mar Thoma Church.  This special time of the year, we try to examine ourselves and see what we can change so that we can be more like Our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ.  Often we focus on what we need to change in ourselves, but we also need to see what as a family, a church, and a community we need to change.   In some homes it might be to start family prayer again.  In other homes it might be trying to have meals as a family, so that a stronger fellowship can be created.  Also as a church and a community there are changes that need to be made.


It is because the Lord loves us that he wants us to lead a truly fulfilling life.  A loving, caring, sharing life.  A life where we build the relationships that brings us and others closer to God.   
Jesus the Christ preached, “Repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near. (Matthew 4:17).”  Repent means so much more than to feel sorry.  One of the Jewish words for sin is chet which means “to go astray.”  So the word that we translate repent really means “return.”  Change your life and return to God.  Stop doing what you want and do what God wants and do it now for the kingdom of God is near.


May the Lord enable all of us to properly use this Lent season to return to God and live the life God wants us to.


Rev. Shibi
