*Leaders are made not born*

Dear believers in Christ, 

Our postmodern world looks for good and committed leaders. Everyone has a leadership role to play as a parent , spouse, family member, friend etc. Leadership skill can be learned, developed and improved, but this doesn't happen overnight. It may take life time . The key for successful leadership is influence not authority, you never become a successful leader if you don't have influence . It is not the position that makes the leader but it is the leader that makes the position. Leadership should have credibility , integrity and consistency of character . Character and leadership credibility always go hand in hand .

QUALITIES OF A LEADER

High character, positive attitude , self confidence , risk taking ability, motivating self and others, initiative , dynamism ,simplicity , patience , dedication, open minded, visionary , ability to take decision , approachable , good listener , facilitator.

JESUS THE GREATEST LEADER EVER

In Jesus Christ we have more than just a spiritual leader; In Jesus we see a practical and effective leadership model for all generation. Jesus transformed twelve ordinary disciple as great leaders through them God reversed the world history. Jesus 's leadership was liberating one. No wonder Jesus is perfect and greatest servant leadership role made of all time.

* "People ask the difference between leader and a boss. Leader leads and the Boss drives" (Roosevelt) * 

Everyone is a leader in family , Church and society. We should have right vision for our future so we can translate our vision to reality for the fulfillment of Kingdom of God. This month we are celebrating Sevikasangam day , Senior citizen day and also our National festival Onam. Let all our celebration enrich our fellowship and mutuality. May The Almighty God bless each one of us with His Grace and Love.
