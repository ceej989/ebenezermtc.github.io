Dear all,

The Ebenezer youth will be participating in a basketball tournament organized by Epiphany Mar Thoma Church.  The tournament will be Sept 3, 2016 Saturday starting at 9am.  Everyone is invited to come support our church.

The facility we will be playing at is located at:

Entrance fee is $10 going to the charity "Homes for Homeless"

The 3 teams we will be playing are St. Andrews, St. Thomas and St. Stephens. Based on how we perform we can then move onto the next round (playoffs).
