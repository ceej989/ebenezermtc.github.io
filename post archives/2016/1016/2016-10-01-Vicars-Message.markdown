*Leaders are made not born*

Dear believers in Christ, 

Brokenness for more fruitful experience. Brokenness is a process for more maturity and fruitfulness. In this bible passage Jesus gives a lesson about  His life with the comparison of wheat. 
God  uses  broken  things:

	Broken soil to produce a crop
	Broken clouds to produce rain
	Broken grain to produce bread
	Broken bread to give strength  to human body

Brokenness  is the surrender of our heart, mind and body to Christ. Brokenness is what  we allow God to make of us. Brokenness brings wholeness in our life. The amazing paradox  which Jesus says . it is only by death that you can gain life. It is only by spending life that you can retain it. It is only by serving that greatness coming. 

What are the changes of corn or wheat when it is planted
a)  Store room security
b)  Wheat has been thrown from comfort zone to danger zone
c)  Burial of wheat
d)  Softening the hard shell of wheat
e)  Transformatory  stages of wheat
f)  The corn of wheat opens:- Openness
g)  Resurrection of corn:-  Flowering-Fruitfulness
	
For abundance of life we all should go through burial and resurrection process of wheat  for a meaningful Christian life, this is what Jesus Christ has shown in His life through the way of cross.. For  abundance of life and resurrection we have to go through a dying process:

	Your pride has to die
	Your worries have to die
	Your greed has to die
	Your selfishness  has  to die
	You wrong lifestyle has to die
	
In contemporary world religion is dividing factor or unifying factor? Today's world we see the blood shedding ,terrorism, fanaticism  and genocide in the name of God , but bible presenting God as a loving God and He has broken His life on the Calvary  for the abundance of life and the salvation of the world . So as a Christian  we have a great mission from Jesus Christ to stand for the abundance of life like the mission of wheat  .So our presence be a life giving and dialogical  in a     pluralistic world . This month we have lot of spiritual renewal programs and observing days of organizations. Let all our celebrations be a spiritual  animation to our organizations. Our convention be a time for repentance and renewal. May Almighty Lord use our life more meaningfully and fruitfully in creative manner for His divine purpose



With love and prayers,
