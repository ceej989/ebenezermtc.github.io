* "As you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts, giving thanks to god the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."" (Ephesians:-5;19,20)*

Dear believers in Christ, 

November is the month of thanksgiving . It is a symbolic expression for all days. Thanksgiving day is a distinctive holiday for Americans. It doesn't commemorate a battle or anyone's birthday or anniversary, it is a day set aside to express our nation's thanks to our God Almighty. There is a danger when we determine our thanksgiving on the basis of how much we have possessed . Material things will change but main thing is our relationship with God.
            
              * "Be joyful always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus" 
              (1 Thessalonians:-5:16-18)*

Four things that keep us away from thankful mind
a) Our pride or arrogant nature
b) Constant complaining attitude
c) Forgetting the history of God's marvelous ways in the crisis our life situations
d) There is not much awareness about Grace of God in our life


How to present thanksgiving to God Almighty?
a)Thanksgiving to God should be expressed through language , music or other body gestures
b)Thanksgiving to God Almighty should be an expensive matter eg: First fruit
c)God Almighty expect thanksgiving from all His creatures


Creator God do expect thanksgiving from all the creatures of the world. In our worship service thanksgiving prayer has very important role to praise the Lord. True thankfulness should be the mark of God's community. Thankless life is a big sin, we need a proper perspective about thanksgiving day. It is not mere an American holiday, it points out Godly way of life. Thanksgiving is an attitude not a day observation. Why we praise God, because He is our creator, provider, sustainer and redeemer. Let us celebrate thanksgiving day with thankful heart for the mercy and Grace of God. May the God Almighty empower us to do Thy will for the extension of the Kingdom of God. May the God Almighty bless each one of us.

With love and prayers,
