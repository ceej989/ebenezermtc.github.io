Christmas  is season of dreams. Dream of assurance, dreams of hope, dreams of peace. Christmas is about miracles of transformation. Transformation in the life of  Zachariah and  Elizabeth, through the birth of John  the Baptist, transformation of Joseph and Mary through the birth of Jesus Christ. The  shepherds were outcast but they were recognized  by God. In Christmas fear transformed into joy, bewilderment was transformed into wonderment.

a) *Christmas informs the culture*

	The message is that God loves this world and He cares about us. Main message of Christmas are " Don't be afraid", "joy for all", "peace for all". Christmas announce that there are reason for  hope, joy and peace.  Jesus is wonderful counselor ,mighty God , everlasting  Father , Prince of peace. This is the message about Jesus Christ with which Christmas  informs the world.  Christmas says God is  Immanuel  ie: He is with us

b) *Christmas transforms the culture*

  Christmas is message about changing the world . it talks about  transformation of individual and the world . We are transformed by the Gospel in order to transform the culture around us.  We have a great culture ie: Christmas culture that will transform a wicked person to Holy saint. As a Christian are we a failure to influence world according to divine culture?. Our ultimate loyalty should be to the culture of Jesus Christ or His Kingdom values
  
C)  *Christmas forms a new culture*

	Birth of Jesus Christ was beginning of new things . His Kingdom would replace the kingdom of world . Christmas is announcement of new worldly order, through Christmas  we got the opportunity to become new creation in Christ. In Christmas there are hope for hopeless , homeless, powerless, untouchable, convicted , uneducated, outcaste and cultureless . The culture of Christmas is self emptying love, give our life for the blessing of others. Let this Christmas season be a meaningful  celebration for each one of us. All our Carol rounds , Carol service and Watch night service be a God experiencing fellowship.


With love and prayers,
