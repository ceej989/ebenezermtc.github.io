*Greater love no one than this, then to lay down one's life for his friend ( John-15:13)*

Dear believers in Christ, 

Memorial day is a thanks giving day to those who gave their best for this nation. Soldiers of this land died for our freedom & security. How many of us know large number of American soldiers were died in civil war, war with Spain, Iraq war, Afghan war, first and second World war, etc. We have to remember vision of our founding fathers and mothers. they had desire to do the will of  God through this Nation. 

Memorial day is the beginning of summer vacation, barbecues in the backyard, and family get togetherness. It is a day more than off from work, it is the day to remember those who have given their lives for the social, cultural, and spiritual changes of this nation.

	a. Soldiers died for our freedom and security
	We know lot of soldiers sacrificed their lives for the prosperity of this country. So we have lot of freedom in this country, so we have freedom for prayer  and worship, express our own ideas, vote for our leadership and so on. "Freedom is not a free matter", there are people who have paid great price for our freedom ; we call them soldiers.

	b. The saints who have died for their faith
	Let us remember martyrs of Christianity, Christian ministers in prison, Christian workers who are working in countries where there is no religious freedom. The disciples of Jesus Christ tortured and executed publically. On this memorial day let us remember those who have lived for authentic truth and left us an example of faith.

	c. The savior who died for our forgiveness and salvation  
	Jesus Christ instituted Holy Qurbana and said do it in the remembrance of me. Who is a hero?  A hero is someone who has given his or her life for a great or right cause. Jesus Christ is the evergreen hero in the history of the world who died for the sins of humanity through his death we got salvation and forgiveness, Let us remember those who have given their life for our freedom and security. Let us remember the great saints and martyrs who have sacrificed  their lives for a solid faith. Let us remember our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for His mighty and marvelous deeds for our salvation.
	
Even though  our country is founded on eternal values of Almighty God we have lot of immoral problems here but still it is a best place in world to live with all freedom. Let us pray for revival, let us look to Jesus, in order that our land be healed, blessed and progressed. May God Bless America. Let us have a meaningful summer days  with great joy and happiness!


With love and prayers,
