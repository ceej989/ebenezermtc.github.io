Dearly beloved in Christ, Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

_"Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy for all the people. For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour who is the Messiah”_ (Proverbs 14:26-27)


We are going to celebrate Christmas in coming days. Christmas is the day on which God took birth as a human being. On this day heaven and earth unite and it is the day of joy and gladness. It is a day of great joy. 
Christmas is a Happy day, which is relevant to all mankind. That day God who is invisible and infinite was born as a helpless babe. That day infancy became glorified and sublime.

The joy that comes from Christmas is spiritual. With Christ's birth, an ever-cherished dream of humanity has been realized.  The irony is that we do all this in the name of Jesus who had no place to be born, no place to lay his head. He had nothing and lived as a poor man. We forget this when we flow money to celebrate his birthday.

Two elegantly dressed ladies arrived at a five-star hotel and ordered food. As they were enjoying themselves a friend who passed by asked them: "What are you celebrating? One of them replied: It is my son's second birthday". "But where is he? Oh, I left him with my mother. He is very mischievous. He won't let us eat in peace". Yes! This is how we celebrate Christmas today. We do it without Jesus because he is such a "nuisance" when we celebrate Christmas in star hotels, spending huge amounts for food and liquor. The largest number of accidents take place on Christmas day because nobody is in his senses that day. They float in liquor. However, the joy that people have today is not the temporary moments of happiness people get when they lose themselves in drinks and licentious activities. 

The angel proclaimed the news of his birth to the world thus: “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people"(Luke 2:7). Christ came to drive away the powers of evil and to emancipate all people. This is the reason for joy but today we rejoice in his birth with the powers of evil and darkness.
Another reason for joy is that Jesus who controls history enters history. It is no longer a God who is away, far in some remote place. He became flesh and lived amidst us. He is part of our experiences. The name Immanuel means God with us. He became human to become identified with all our experiences. 

Jews had cherished such a longing and we find in the works of the prophets, the hopes and dreams of a Saviour, a king, a Messiah. The prophets and visionaries had prophesied the birth of Christ, far in advance the Jewish priests and other eminent men were waiting to see him. 
However, when he was born, it was two unexpected groups of people who were lucky enough to see him. They were of two classes and of different social status. They were the illiterate shepherds of Judea and the wise men of the East The illiterate shepherds were poor men unstained by the complexities of organized religion. These innocent people were the first to hear of the birth of Christ and the first to see infant Jesus. 
They are men who fulfill these words of Jesus. "Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God. They had no power of reason and intelligence to doubt what the angels said or to question the 'irrationality' of their proclamation. They took the words of angels at the face-value and acted accordingly. There are even today some who wish to have a vision of God. But they will not see him unless they remove the cobwebs in their hearts. It is the purity of the heart and not the outward performance of rites and rituals, that brings a vision of God. 

The wise men of the east are believed to be the royal magi who were great scholars in astronomy. So far it has not been possible to know more about these men. A particular star gave them a hint of the birth of a 'king. They set out pursuing the star to find the baby. In fact, for them it was a search for Truth. These wise men give us the message that the vision of God is possible for the seekers after Truth. 
The message of Christmas is Love. St. John reveals it “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life…” (Jn. 3:16)
Jesus came to save us from the powers of evil and darkness. Isaac Newton was proud of his discoveries in the world of science. He made discovery in his personal life. "Jesus is a great Saviour and I am a sinner". Christ emancipated us from sin. This is the spiritual joy that we must experience through Christmas.
May the Lord God Almighty help us to reveal joy and love throughout this season and the new year ahead.
