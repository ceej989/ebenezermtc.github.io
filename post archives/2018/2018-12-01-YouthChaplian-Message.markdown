_"Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors!"_ - Luke 2:14

 
The only way to really get peace in this world is to give Glory to God, the two are connected.  The peace that this world needs and is searching for is a gift from God.  It is believed that the famous French mathematician, philosopher, and physicist – Blaise Pascal said: 

_“There is a God shaped vacuum in the heart of every man which cannot be filled by any created thing, but only by God, the Creator, made known through Jesus.”_  
            
As we are celebrating this Christmas season, and as we are getting ready to enter a new year, let us meditate on the fact that the only thing that can fulfill us is God.  It is by giving glory to God in everything that we do, that we will find peace in this world.  There can be no part of our life that is separated from worshipping God.      

We obtain peace when we understand our true purpose in this world.  We were not created to glorify ourselves and take care of ourselves.  We were created to Glorify God and to take care of each other.
