_"In the fear of the LORD one has strong confidence, and one’s children will have a refuge.  The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, so that one may avoid the snares of death.”_ (Proverbs 14:26-27)

My beloved ones, Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

As many of our children are looking forward for the new academic year, I congratulate everyone and praying to have a blessed academic year to all. Let us set goals in our lives that are centered on Christ and not ourselves. As we all face many challenges, we need to have guidance from the Lord and through Him we will accomplish the tasks that we have. We need to praise God and be thankful for the blessed past and look forward in the future ahead by fearing God and having the understanding and wisdom to His will to prosper in this World. Wisdom is not mere knowledge. Today, we have more knowledge than before. But are we becoming more wise today?


In the present-day context where we are caught up in the grip of global-economic, colonial and oppressive structures- thinking and talking of this kind of wisdom is not a process of persuasion but a call to conversion. We are in a constant need of divine wisdom, which will enable our minds to think in new ways. The wisdom of God inspires hope for humanity and it gives true life. 


**Wisdom Comes from God**: Real wisdom comes from God. His wisdom became known to the wide world. St. James chapter 3 tells us that the wisdom from Heaven is pure, peace-loving, considerate, submissive and full of mercy. It will bear good fruit, be impartial and sincere. The divine wisdom makes one humble and empowers one to live as "peace makers". But: the earthly wisdom will lead one to selfish ambitions and will breed bitter envy in society and it will only create disorder and increase evil practices. 


Wise man will build his house upon the rock. We have the teachings of Jesus Christ in the Sermon on the Mount as we read in the Gospel of Matthew chapters 5,6 and 7. Concluding his teachings there, Jesus speaks of the wise man in contrast to the foolish man. Wise is the one who hears the words of Jesus Christ and puts them into practice. (Matthew 7:24). James in his epistle is also putting the emphasis on, "walking the talk". Jesus clearly says that everyone who says "Lord, Lord" will not enter the kingdom of God but only the one who bears good fruit (Matthew 7:19&21). Jesus looks for faith living among his followers. 


No reason can explain why Jesus, very God of very God, had to die like a criminal on the Cross. St. Paul speaks of it in 1 Cor. 1:20b. 'Had not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? (v. 25). For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength (v. 30)'. Christ Jesus has become for us wisdom from God.


**Wisdom comes through Walking with God and Trusting in God**: The love and care that God provided for us is everlasting. God will provide with what we need, and He will lead us to the right direction. The only thing we must do is to walk with Him and submit ourselves to Him. This is the realization that we cannot be happy or fulfilled by doing things by ourselves, and we cannot move forward into this world on our own. We need to walk with the Lord. By walking with the Lord, it is the trust that we are placing in Him to lead us to the direction where we are supposed to go. 


"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and all who follow his precepts have good understanding" (Psalms 111:10). King Solomon asked for wisdom, more than anything else, when he became king in his young age. King Solomon is one who could have asked the Lord for anything, but he chose to ask the Lord for wisdom. "So, give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong. For who is able to govern this great people of yours?" I Kings 3:9. Solomon knew that to move forward in doing the will of God, he will need to only seek Him for guidance to see satisfaction in his duties. It is the trust he had with the Lord. God was happy to hear a request that was not centered upon the self, but rather on the responsibility given to Solomon to guide his people. Therefore, God provides Solomon with wisdom and much more (I Kings 3:9).


**Wisdom comes through Education**. Education helps us to realize our God, we get a self-understanding and know our surroundings.  In the scriptural tradition of Israelites, God is not a rhetorical object; rather an embodied experience of liberation. It is a God of life who defeats the idols of death. Knowing God means embodying a liberative habitus. It is a life of listening, following and practicing experience of divine justice, freedom and peace. 


Knowing God and realizing self-result in the newer understanding of the social existence. Self is to be divine and thus communitarian. Practicing justice and re-imaging social relations are the result of fearing God and knowing God. Knowing God is not separated from the self-understanding. Revelation of God, in biblical tradition, results the revelation of self. Realizing the human self as the divine self is the theological content of epiphany. Education today must lead us to new epiphanies. 


The purpose of education is not merely to acquire skills and knowledge, but is an enlightening experience, preparing a person for a mature and godly life. Modern education very much focuses on the Academic Excellency. But what is needed is a generation with Good Character and Good behavior. Good behavior is indicative of culture. A pleasing and impressive contact is a very great asset. It will lead us to great heights. What is needed for good behavior is nurture and not different education systems. It is the nurture one gets from parents that is the foundation of good behavior. We learn the first lessons of behavior from the members of our family. Children must be taught how to receive guests courteously with humility and love. It is from parents that they must imbibe all this. He who is concerned about his behavior will always be careful to be polite and pleasant in his interactions with everybody.


As we look back in analysis of our lives, we need to reflect on the goodness that God has showered upon us. Often the blessings that we have, we take them for granted and many times forget to thank God for His manifold blessings. God has provided everything that we need and blessed us with numerous things that we want. May God help us to grow in wisdom and transform the society for God's glory.



With prayers and Blessings, 
In God’s Ministry,
