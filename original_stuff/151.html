destroy the vineyards</span></b></p><p></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">This
is a phrase that we read in the book of Song of Songs chapter 2 verse 15. The
book of Song of Songs exhibits the triumph of pure and spontaneous love, over
all worldly and unworthy enticements. God’s relationship to His people is the
noblest example of this form of love. This love is expected from the family
relationships especially in the husband and wife relationship. Song of Songs portrays
the importance of having a pure and spontaneous love in the family
relationships. Chapter 2 verses 10 onwards the writer is explaining about the
beauty of a vineyard in the spring season. The vineyard is awesome because of
its beauty that is seen, the smell that is felt, the sweet voice of the birds
that is heard and an embracement that is received by an invitation. A family is
the combination of all these expressions of love and affection that is seen,
smelled, heard and touched. God’s relationship to His people is the highest
expression of this kind of a relationship. </span></p><p></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">After
explaining this elegant picture of the vineyard that is the miniature of the
family the writer is saying there are little foxes that destroy the beauty of
these relationships. The fox in the vineyard is exceedingly destructive. The
food of that animal is not merely flesh, but honey and fruits, particularly
grapes; and the young foxes not merely devour the fruit, but by their
sportiveness, and by the action of their teeth on the bark of the vine, destroy
as much us they devour. They destroy the blooming vineyard that is smelled,
seen, heard and touched by their continued actions of finding their food and
prey. Family is the basis of any society and church and where ever we see a breaking
of that relationship we see the downfall of that society or church. Here the
author is saying the reason of the destruction of this beautiful vineyard is
the attack and involvement of these little foxes.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">When
we consider the vineyard that is mentioned in this passage as the beautiful
picture of a family, we also need to be aware of the little foxes that destroy
this beautiful vineyard. What are these little foxes? Do we have these little
foxes in our own families? I think these little foxes are everywhere and if we
are not able to identify them and catch them, then we will be in trouble. Many
of the family breaking stories are based on these little foxes and the result
of not knowing how to handle these little foxes. We are all seriously concerned
about petty/little things and that finally grows to disasters in the family
lives. Who handles the remote control of the TV, who takes the garbage bag
outside? Who helps the children in doing home works?, who drops and picks up
children? Who buys groceries? The list will go on and on. Many a time we stuck
up in these petty little things and like little foxes, who intruded into the
vineyard, we end up in serious problems. We should be able to handle these
types little foxes and catch them in the beginning itself.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">The
other little foxes are our ‘little sins’ such as anger, ego, jealousies,
complexes, unconcern etc. These things normally don’t come to the visibility in
the first phase but gradually grows to a stage where we are not able to handle
it. These little foxes are little more dangerous than the first group. These
may not look dangerous in the first few years but will show its ferocious
nature when it develops. As the writer says we need to catch these little foxes
while they are entering in the vineyard.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">There
is a third group of little foxes that gradually intrudes into the family
vineyards are certain addictions. It starts as little things but will be
dangerous while time progresses. One glass of alcohol, one party in a month,
one sexual site, one extravagant spending, one pub experience, one extra
marital relation and the list will be numerous. These are all little foxes that
gradually take control of our lives and finally result in a disastrous ruin. We
need to be away from these little foxes. Some people think that they will be
able to handle the situations like this because everything will be in control
at the beginning but they will see the danger when it grows beyond their
control. The best way is to avoid these situations and as Paul says ‘run away
from these evils’.&nbsp; </span></p><p></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">There
are many other little foxes that ruin our beautiful vineyards and the best way
to handle this is the commitment that the writer talks in verse 16, “<span style="color:black;background-color:white;">My beloved is mine and I am his”. If we
have this commitment strong in our relationships especially in the families we
will be able to catch these little foxes. This commitment is also the
commitment that we have with our God, ‘I am His and he is mine’</span>. I wish
and pray that our relationships especially in our families will grow in this
commitment. May God bless us all.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">V,
